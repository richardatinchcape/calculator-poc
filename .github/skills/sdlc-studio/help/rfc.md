# /sdlc-studio rfc – Design Exploration (Request For Comments)

## You can just ask

SDLC Studio is model-invoked - say it in plain language:

| Just say... | Runs |
| --- | --- |
| "We've got a couple of design options to weigh up - write them up" | `/sdlc-studio rfc create` |
| "Which design decisions are still open?" | `/sdlc-studio rfc list --status draft` |
| "Which of these proposals have gone stale?" | `/sdlc-studio rfc review` |
| "Let's go through the open proposals and decide each one" | `/sdlc-studio rfc decide` |
| "We've picked the approach - lock it in and raise the work" | `/sdlc-studio rfc accept --rfc RFC-0001` |
| "We're not doing this one - close it off" | `/sdlc-studio rfc close --rfc RFC-0001` |

> **Source of truth:** `reference-rfc.md` – detailed workflow steps.

An **RFC** captures an *unsettled* design space – multiple viable options and open
decisions – and drives it to a decision. It sits **before** a CR:

| Artifact | When | Shape |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **RFC** | Design is unsettled – options + open decisions, often cross-repo | Explore → decide |
| **CR** | The change is already clear | Propose → action into epics |
| **ADR** (TRD §) | A decision already made | Record context + consequences |

> Rule of thumb: if you'd write "Option A vs Option B" or "open question", it's an RFC. An **accepted RFC spawns CRs** (its workstreams); it is never actioned into epics directly.

## Quick Reference

```text
/sdlc-studio rfc                        # Ask what to do (interactive)
/sdlc-studio rfc create                 # Draft a new RFC
/sdlc-studio rfc list                   # List RFCs
/sdlc-studio rfc list --status draft    # Filter by status
/sdlc-studio rfc review                 # Review RFC ages + open decisions
/sdlc-studio rfc decide                 # Decision session: triage the Draft backlog -> accept/defer/withdraw
/sdlc-studio rfc accept --rfc RFC-0001  # Record the decision + spawn/link CRs
/sdlc-studio rfc close  --rfc RFC-0001  # Supersede or withdraw
```

## Actions

### create

Draft a new RFC from `templates/core/rfc.md` into `sdlc-studio/rfcs/RFC{NNNN}-{slug}.md`, add a row to `sdlc-studio/rfcs/_index.md`. Captures: problem/context, goals/non-goals, **≥2 design options** (with pros/cons/effort), **Open Decisions** (the unsettled cores, each with an owner + how-it-resolves), architecture impact, risks, and a phased workstream plan. Status starts **Draft**.

### list

List RFCs; filter `--status {draft|in-review|accepted|superseded|withdrawn}`, `--priority P1`, `--author`.

### review

Flag RFCs needing attention: Draft/In Review older than ~14 days with no movement; Open Decisions unresolved > 7 days; Accepted RFCs whose spawned CRs don't exist / aren't linked back.

### decide

The multi-RFC **decision session**: `scripts/rfc.py decide` digests each Draft/In-Review RFC (open-decision count, workstreams, has-recommendation, `ready_for_decision`); you then brief each (core decision, options + leaning, what acceptance spawns, recommendation) and choose per RFC: **accept** (optionally scoped), **defer** (record the trigger), or **withdraw**. Accept routes to `accept` below. See `reference-rfc.md#decide`.

### accept

Promote an RFC whose Open Decisions are resolved: fill the **Decision** section (chosen option + rationale), set status **Accepted**, and **spawn the workstream CRs** (one per WS row) cross-linked back to the RFC. Cross-repo RFCs spawn CRs in each repo – confirm next free numbers against `origin/main` first (see `reference-cr.md`).

### close

Set **Superseded** (point to the replacing RFC) or **Withdrawn** (record why). Update the index.

## Lifecycle

```text
Draft → In Review → Accepted ──(spawns)──▶ CRs → Epics → Stories → … → ADR (decision recorded)
            │
            ├──▶ Superseded   (replaced by a later RFC)
            └──▶ Withdrawn    (not pursued)
```

## Output

- **RFC file:** `sdlc-studio/rfcs/RFC{NNNN}-{slug}.md`
- **Index:** `sdlc-studio/rfcs/_index.md`

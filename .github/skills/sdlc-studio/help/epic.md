# /sdlc-studio epic - Epics

## You can just ask

SDLC Studio is model-invoked - say it in plain language:

| Just say... | Runs |
| --- | --- |
| "Break the requirements into epics" | `/sdlc-studio epic` |
| "Group these features from a technical angle" | `/sdlc-studio epic --perspective engineering` |
| "How are the epics coming along?" | `/sdlc-studio epic review` |
| "Sketch out the work for the agent engine epic" | `/sdlc-studio epic plan --epic EP0004` |
| "Build out everything in the agent engine epic" | `/sdlc-studio epic implement --epic EP0004` |

## Quick Reference

```
/sdlc-studio epic                   # Generate Epics from PRD
/sdlc-studio epic review            # Review Epic status
/sdlc-studio epic --perspective engineering  # TRD-aligned technical focus
/sdlc-studio epic --perspective product      # PRD-aligned product focus
/sdlc-studio epic --perspective test         # TSD-aligned testing focus
/sdlc-studio epic plan --epic EP0004      # Preview workflow for all stories
/sdlc-studio epic implement --epic EP0004 # Execute workflow for all stories
```

## Prerequisites

- PRD must exist at `sdlc-studio/prd.md`
- Run `/sdlc-studio prd` first if missing

## Actions

### generate (default)

Parse PRD and group features into Epics.

**What happens:**

1. Reads Feature Inventory from PRD
2. Groups related features (5-8 per Epic)
3. Creates Epic files with business context, scope, acceptance criteria
4. Creates `sdlc-studio/epics/_index.md` registry

**Grouping heuristics:**

- Features sharing same user type → same Epic
- Features with shared dependencies → same Epic
- Features forming complete user journey → same Epic

**Perspective option:**

Use `--perspective` to generate epics with specific focus aligned to document types:

| Perspective | Aligns With | Focus Areas |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| `engineering` | TRD | Components, APIs, data models, tech dependencies |
| `product` | PRD | User value, success metrics, priority rationale |
| `test` | TSD | Test types, coverage targets, risk-based priorities |

### review

Review Epic status based on Stories and codebase. **Cascades by default** - reviews epic and all changed stories/code.

```bash
/sdlc-studio epic review                  # Cascade review (default)
/sdlc-studio epic review --quick          # Epic only, skip stories
/sdlc-studio epic review --resume         # Resume from pause point
/sdlc-studio epic review --epic EP0001    # Target specific epic
```

**Flags:**

| Flag | Description | Default |
| ------ | ------------- | --------- |
| `--quick` | Skip cascade, review only the epic | false |
| `--resume` | Resume from where review paused | false |
| `--epic` | Target specific epic | all epics |

**What happens (cascade mode):**

1. Builds review queue - stories/code changed since last review
2. Reviews changed story specs against implementation
3. Reviews changed code for quality issues
4. Reviews epic-level acceptance criteria
5. Stores findings in `sdlc-studio/reviews/RV{NNNN}-*.md`
6. Updates `.local/review-state.json` with review timestamps

**What happens (quick mode):**

1. Reads all Epics and their linked Stories
2. Calculates completion from Story status
3. Updates status and acceptance criteria checkboxes
4. No deep story/code review

## Output

**Files:**

- `sdlc-studio/epics/EP{NNNN}-{slug}.md` per Epic
- `sdlc-studio/epics/_index.md` registry

**Status values:** Draft | Ready | Approved | In Progress | Done

**Status rules:**

- New epics start as "Draft"
- `epic review` suggests "Done" when all stories complete, but user confirms

> **Source of truth:** `reference-decisions.md` → Status Transition Rules

**Epic sections:**

- Summary
- Business Context (problem, value, metrics)
- Scope (in/out, affected personas)
- Acceptance Criteria
- Dependencies
- Risks & Assumptions
- Technical Considerations
- Sizing & Effort
- Story Breakdown
- Test Plan link

## Examples

```
# Generate all Epics from PRD
/sdlc-studio epic

# Review Epic status after Stories complete
/sdlc-studio epic review

# Use custom PRD location
/sdlc-studio epic --prd ./docs/requirements.md

# Generate with engineering perspective (TRD-aligned)
/sdlc-studio epic --perspective engineering

# Generate with product perspective (PRD-aligned)
/sdlc-studio epic --perspective product

# Generate with test perspective (TSD-aligned)
/sdlc-studio epic --perspective test
```

## Next Steps

After generating Epics:

```
/sdlc-studio story                # Generate Stories from Epics
/sdlc-studio test-plan            # Generate Test Plans for Epics
```

## Naming Convention

- ID format: `EP0001`, `EP0002`, etc. (global numbering)
- Slug: kebab-case from title, max 50 chars
- Example: `EP0001-user-authentication.md`

## Workflow Commands

Automate the full implementation workflow for all stories in an epic.

### plan

Preview the implementation workflow for all stories in an epic.

```
/sdlc-studio epic plan --epic EP0004
/sdlc-studio epic plan --epic EP0004 --agentic   # Include agentic wave analysis
```

**What happens:**

1. Lists all stories in epic with status
2. Filters to stories that need implementation (Ready, not Done)
3. Analyses cross-story dependencies
4. Determines execution order (topological sort)
5. If `--agentic`: analyses hub file overlap and assigns concurrent waves
6. Shows aggregate work preview

**Output:**

```
## Epic Workflow Plan: EP0004

**Epic:** Agent Execution Engine
**Stories:** 8 total (3 Done, 5 Ready)

### Execution Order

| Order | Story | Title | Dependencies | Approach |
|-------|-------|-------|--------------|----------|
| 1 | US0023 | Config Schema | None | TDD |
| 2 | US0024 | Action Queue API | US0023 | TDD |
| 3 | US0025 | Script Parser | US0023 | TDD |
| 4 | US0026 | Action Executor | US0024, US0025 | TDD |
| 5 | US0027 | Agent Runner | US0026 | Test-After |

### Summary
- **Stories to implement:** 5
- **TDD stories:** 4
- **Test-After stories:** 1
- **Estimated phases:** 40 (8 per story)

### Dependency Graph
US0023 --+-- US0024 --+-- US0026 -- US0027
         +-- US0025 --+

Ready to execute? Run: /sdlc-studio epic implement --epic EP0004
```

### implement

Execute the full implementation workflow for all stories in an epic.

```
/sdlc-studio epic implement --epic EP0004
/sdlc-studio epic implement --epic EP0004 --agentic   # Run safe waves concurrently
/sdlc-studio epic implement --epic EP0004 --story US0024
/sdlc-studio epic implement --epic EP0004 --skip US0025
```

**Flags:**

| Flag | Description |
| ------ | ------------- |
| `--epic EP000X` | Target epic (required) |
| `--story US000X` | Start from specific story |
| `--skip US000X` | Skip specific story |
| `--agentic` | Autonomous concurrent execution with wave analysis (cross-layer only) |

**What happens:**

1. Loads or creates epic workflow plan
2. Processes stories in dependency order (or concurrent waves with `--agentic`)
3. Runs `story implement` for each story (concurrent within a wave if `--agentic`)
4. Tracks overall progress
5. Pauses on story failure with resume capability
6. Runs full test suite after each wave completes (if `--agentic`)
7. Updates epic status on completion

**State tracking:**
Creates `sdlc-studio/workflows/WF{NNNN}-{epic-slug}.md` to track progress.

**Story execution:**

For each story in dependency order:

1. Check dependencies are Done
2. Run `story implement --story US000X`
3. On success: mark story Done, continue to next
4. On failure: pause epic workflow, save state

**Resume after pause:**

```
/sdlc-studio epic implement --epic EP0004 --story US0024
```

# /sdlc-studio hint - Next Step Suggestion

## You can just ask

SDLC Studio is model-invoked - say it in plain language:

| Just say... | Runs |
| --- | --- |
| "What should I do next?" | `/sdlc-studio hint` |
| "I'm stuck, where do I go from here?" | `/sdlc-studio hint` |
| "What's the next step on this project?" | `/sdlc-studio hint` |
| "Is anything blocking me?" | `/sdlc-studio hint` |
| "Give me the big picture instead" | `/sdlc-studio status` |

Get a single actionable next step based on current pipeline state.

> **Deterministic helper.** `python3 "$CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR/scripts/status.py" hint --format json`
> returns `{next_command, reason}` from the mechanical ladder. Apply judgement only for the
> blocker and implement-vs-plan branches it flags.

## Usage

```
/sdlc-studio hint                    # Get next recommended action
```

## How It Works

Checks pipeline state in priority order and returns the first applicable action. Also detects blockers that may prevent progress.

## Pre-flight: Version Check

**First tool call:** `Glob: sdlc-studio/.version` (the schema may also live in
`sdlc-studio/.config.yaml` - a fresh v3 project has only the config file)

| Result | Action |
| -------- | -------- |
| No sdlc-studio/ directory | Proceed (new project) |
| `schema_version` 2 or 3 (in .version or .config.yaml) | Proceed (current schemas) |
| Both absent, or `schema_version` < 2 | Check `sdlc-studio/.local/upgrade-dismissed.json` |
| └─ dismissed: true | Proceed |
| └─ not dismissed | Prompt user (see below) |

**Prompt if needed:**

```
question: "Project uses a superseded artefact schema. Upgrade to the current one?"
header: "Upgrade"
options:
  - "Preview" → run upgrade --dry-run, then continue
  - "Not now" → continue
  - "Don't ask again" → write dismissal file, continue
```

**Output prefix:** Start response with `**Schema:** v2 ✓` / `**Schema:** v3 ✓` or
`**Schema:** superseded (reason)`

## Priority Logic

| # | Condition | Suggested Action | Command |
| --- | ----------- | ------------------ | --------- |
| 1 | No PRD + existing code | Extract PRD from codebase | `prd generate` |
| 2 | No PRD + no code | Create PRD interactively | `prd create` |
| 3 | No TRD + existing code | Extract TRD from codebase | `trd generate` |
| 4 | No TRD + no code | Create TRD interactively | `trd create` |
| 5 | No TSD | Create test strategy | `tsd` |
| 6 | No personas | Create personas | `persona` |
| 7 | No epics | Generate epics | `epic` |
| 8 | No stories | Generate stories | `story` |
| 9 | Paused workflow | Resume workflow | `story implement --from-phase N` |
| 10 | Starting new epic (no Done stories yet) | Review epic state and dependencies | `epic review --epic {id}` |
| 11 | Stories in Ready (multiple, epic reviewed) | Preview epic workflow | `epic plan --epic {id}` |
| 12 | Stories in Ready (single, epic reviewed) | Execute story workflow | `story implement --story {id}` (recommended) or `code plan --story {id}` (manual control) |
| 13 | Stories in Draft (epic reviewed) | Execute story workflow | `story implement --story {id}` (recommended) or `code plan --story {id}` (manual control) |
| 14 | Stories in Planned | Execute workflow | `story implement --story {id}` |
| 15 | Stories in In Progress | Continue workflow or verify | `code verify` |
| 16 | Stories in Review | Run tests | `code test --story {id}` |
| 17 | All stories Done | Review epic | `epic review` |

## Output Format

### Standard Output

```
## Next Step

**Action:** Generate user stories from epics
**Run:** `/sdlc-studio story`
**Why:** 3 epics ready, no stories yet
```

### Story Ready Output

```
## Next Step

**Action:** Execute story workflow
**Run:**
  /sdlc-studio story implement --story US0004   Full workflow (recommended)
  /sdlc-studio code plan --story US0004         Step-by-step (manual control)
**Why:** US0004 is Ready
```

### With Blocker

When an issue prevents smooth progress:

```
## Blocker

**Issue:** 2 unresolved open questions in plan PL0001
**Fix:** Edit sdlc-studio/plans/PL0001-*.md and check off resolved questions

---

## Next Step

**Action:** Implement planned story
**Run:** `/sdlc-studio code implement`
**Why:** US0003 is planned and ready (blocked by above)
```

### All Complete

```
## Pipeline Complete

All stories are done.
**Run:** `/sdlc-studio prd review`
**Why:** Check for new features or scope changes

Also consider:
- `/sdlc-studio test-spec review` to sync test coverage
- `/sdlc-studio epic create` to start a new epic
```

## Blocker Detection

Checked before returning hint:

### Open Questions

- Unresolved open questions in PRD
- Unresolved open questions in implementation plans

### Dependencies

- Stories blocked by incomplete dependencies
- Test specs blocked by missing stories

### Quality Gates

- Stories in Review with failing tests
- Code check issues blocking merge

### Workflow State

- Paused story workflow (reports phase and error)
- Paused epic workflow (reports story and phase)
- Blocked stories in epic workflow

## Examples

### Early Pipeline

```
$ /sdlc-studio hint

## Next Step

**Action:** Generate PRD from codebase
**Run:** `/sdlc-studio prd generate`
**Why:** No PRD found, existing codebase detected
```

### Starting New Epic

```
$ /sdlc-studio hint

## Next Step

**Action:** Review epic state and dependencies
**Run:** `/sdlc-studio epic review --epic EP0005`
**Why:** EP0005 has no Done stories yet - check dependencies before starting
```

After epic review confirms dependencies are met, hint will suggest `story implement` or `code plan`.

### Mid-Development

```
$ /sdlc-studio hint

## Next Step

**Action:** Execute story workflow
**Run:**
  /sdlc-studio story implement --story US0004   Full workflow (recommended)
  /sdlc-studio code plan --story US0004         Step-by-step (manual control)
**Why:** US0004, US0005 are Ready - starting with US0004
```

### Multiple Ready Stories

```
$ /sdlc-studio hint

## Next Step

**Action:** Preview epic workflow for multiple Ready stories
**Run:** `/sdlc-studio epic plan --epic EP0002`
**Why:** 5 stories in EP0002 are Ready - consider batch execution
```

### Paused Workflow

```
$ /sdlc-studio hint

## Blocker

**Issue:** Story workflow paused at phase 5 (Verify)
**Story:** US0024 - Action Queue API
**Error:** 2 tests failed
**Fix:** Fix failing tests, then resume

---

## Next Step

**Action:** Resume paused workflow
**Run:** `/sdlc-studio story implement --story US0024 --from-phase 5`
**Why:** Workflow paused - needs resume after fix
```

### With Blocker

```
$ /sdlc-studio hint

## Blocker

**Issue:** Unresolved open question in plan PL0002
**Fix:** Answer question in sdlc-studio/plans/PL0002-user-auth.md:45

---

## Next Step

**Action:** Execute different story workflow
**Run:** `/sdlc-studio story implement --story US0003`
**Why:** US0003 has no blockers and is ready
```

## Comparison with Status

| Aspect | `hint` | `status` |
| -------- | -------- | ---------- |
| Output | Single next action | Full pipeline overview |
| Suggested command | Yes, with explanation | Yes, based on top priority |
| Detail | Minimal, actionable | Comprehensive |
| Use case | "What do I do next?" | "What's the big picture?" |

Both commands include a suggested `/sdlc-studio` command. The status command shows it at the end of the dashboard; hint provides more context about why that command is recommended.

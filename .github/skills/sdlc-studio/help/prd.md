# /sdlc-studio prd - Product Requirements Document

## You can just ask

SDLC Studio is model-invoked - say it in plain language:

| Just say... | Runs |
| --- | --- |
| "Help me write a requirements doc for a new project" | `/sdlc-studio prd create` |
| "Work out what this codebase already does and write it up" | `/sdlc-studio prd generate` |
| "Check the requirements still match the code" | `/sdlc-studio prd review` |
| "Document this existing app from scratch, replace the old doc" | `/sdlc-studio prd generate --force` |
| "What should I do after the requirements are done?" | `/sdlc-studio epic` |

## Quick Reference

```
/sdlc-studio prd                    # Ask which mode
/sdlc-studio prd create             # Interactive creation
/sdlc-studio prd generate           # Reverse-engineer from codebase
/sdlc-studio prd review             # Review PRD against codebase
```

## Actions

### create

Interactive conversation to build a PRD from scratch.

**What happens:**

1. Claude asks about project name, purpose, target users
2. You describe features one by one with acceptance criteria
3. Claude asks about non-functional requirements (performance, security)
4. PRD is written to `sdlc-studio/prd.md`

**Best for:** New projects, greenfield development

### generate

Analyse existing codebase and reverse-engineer requirements.

**What happens:**

1. Claude explores your codebase (routes, components, tests, config)
2. Extracts features and infers acceptance criteria
3. Documents technical architecture found
4. PRD is written with confidence markers ([HIGH], [MEDIUM], [LOW])

> **Source of truth:** `reference-philosophy.md#generate-mode` - explains why generated specs must be validated by tests.

**Best for:** Existing projects needing documentation

### review

Review PRD against current codebase, update feature status.

**What happens:**

1. Reads existing PRD from `sdlc-studio/prd.md`
2. Searches codebase for each feature's implementation
3. Updates status: Complete | Partial | Stubbed | Broken | Not Started
4. Discovers new features not in PRD

**Best for:** Tracking progress, keeping docs current

## Output

**File:** `sdlc-studio/prd.md`

**Sections:**

1. Project Overview
2. Problem Statement
3. Feature Inventory
4. Functional Requirements
5. Non-Functional Requirements
6. AI/ML Specifications (if applicable)
7. Data Architecture
8. Integration Map
9. Configuration Reference
10. Test Coverage Analysis
11. Technical Debt Register
12. Documentation Gaps
13. Recommendations
14. Open Questions

## Examples

```
# Start fresh project
/sdlc-studio prd create

# Document existing codebase
/sdlc-studio prd generate

# Review status after sprint
/sdlc-studio prd review

# Overwrite existing PRD
/sdlc-studio prd generate --force
```

## Next Steps

After creating PRD, **offer the team** (never auto-run): the PRD is the richest input
`persona generate --team` will ever have - it grows named working seats and a
stakeholder panel from this project. Then:

```
/sdlc-studio persona generate --team    # Meet your team (offer - defaults keep working)
/sdlc-studio persona                    # Define user personas
/sdlc-studio epic                       # Generate Epics from PRD
```

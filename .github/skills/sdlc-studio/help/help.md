# /sdlc-studio help - Command Reference

This is the full command catalogue. SKILL.md stays lean and routes here on
`/sdlc-studio help`. For the full flag reference see `help/arguments.md`; for the
reference-file and template catalogue see `help/references.md`.

## You can just ask

SDLC Studio is model-invoked - say it in plain language:

| Just say... | Runs |
| --- | --- |
| "where are we?" | `/sdlc-studio status` |
| "what should I do next?" | `/sdlc-studio hint` |
| "clear the open bugs" | `/sdlc-studio sprint --bugs Open --goal done` |
| "drive the proposed changes to done" | `/sdlc-studio sprint --crs Proposed --goal done` |
| "build the docs from the existing codebase" | `/sdlc-studio prd generate` |
| "fix any status drift" | `/sdlc-studio reconcile` |

## Getting Started

**Sprint (recommended) - Goal-Driven Development.** Set a batch and a goal; the loop
drives the proven lifecycle - decompose -> TDD -> verify -> conformance -> independent critic
-> green commit - to that goal, pausing only for the triage approval and any material issue.

```text
/sdlc-studio status                                  # where the pipeline is right now
/sdlc-studio sprint --crs Proposed --goal done   # drive a tranche of CRs to done
/sdlc-studio sprint --bugs Open --goal done      # clear the open bugs
/sdlc-studio sprint --epic EP0007 --goal done    # deliver one epic end to end
```

See `reference-sprint.md` for the loop, the Definition of Done, and `--goal` / `--order`.

**By hand.** The full per-tool pipeline is still here for fine control - greenfield authoring,
brownfield `generate`, a one-off story. Lead with `hint` and follow the step it gives you; the
catalogue and worked workflows below cover every tool.

```text
/sdlc-studio hint                    # single next step (drives the manual pipeline)
/sdlc-studio prd generate            # author / generate specs (see Requirements Pipeline)
/sdlc-studio code plan               # plan + implement a story (see Development Pipeline)
```

## All Commands

### Sprint, Product Layer & Maintenance

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/sdlc-studio sprint <batch> --goal <rung>` | Goal-Driven Development loop: drive a prioritised tranche along the **goal ladder** `triage -> plan -> design -> done` (cumulative stop-points; natural language maps to the furthest rung). The primary delivery workflow |
| `/sdlc-studio handoff generate` / `show` | The run-close handoff guide: the single "here is where you pick up" document a run that stopped short of its goal owes a human - every remaining item with its pointer (file / AC / check) and a suitability tag (copilot-tail vs judgement), plus a worklist the next `sprint plan --worklist` reads back |
| `/sdlc-studio decisions add` / `list` / `promote` | Project decisions log (the project spine + delegated-agent context): append a decision, list them, or promote a resolved open question |
| `/sdlc-studio pvd create` / `pvd sync` / `pvd drift` | Product Vision Document: the multi-repo product layer above the PRD |
| `/sdlc-studio gate` | Portable, ecosystem-neutral CI quality gate over the deterministic checks |
| `/sdlc-studio deploy` | Orchestrate-only deploy last-mile: gate, verify, record (operator-triggered, never autonomous) |
| `/sdlc-studio mutation` | Executable mutation-check gate: prove the tests can FAIL (killed vs survived per mutation) |
| `/sdlc-studio skill-update` | Upgrade the **installed skill** to a newer SDLC Studio release (one of three "upgrade" surfaces - see `reference-upgrade.md#three-upgrades`) |
| `/sdlc-studio project upgrade` | Upgrade a **consuming project's artefacts and conventions** to the new skill (dry-run; `--apply` for the safe set; reports the judgement items) |
| `/sdlc-studio migrate` | Review EVERY artefact and upgrade where safe: orchestrates project upgrade (conventions + version) + `migrate_v3` sizing + the artefact-review sweep into ONE report - deterministic upgrades applied, judgement items (refine/triage/resize) reported with the command. Dry-run; `--apply` writes the safe set |

### Deterministic Artifact Tooling

The tooling sprint uses to create and close artifacts the same way every time (the
[scripts](../reference-scripts.md); run them directly or let sprint drive them):

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `scripts/artifact.py new --type <type> --title ...` | Create any of the 8 numbered artifacts: collision-free id, valid scaffold, index row, parent-epic wiring, `Created-by` + `Raised-by` stamps |
| `scripts/artifact.py new --template full` | Scaffold the full template (all sections) instead of the minimal stub |
| `scripts/artifact.py new --template planning` | The lean pre-implementation tier (story/epic): ACs with `Verify:` + `Verification target:`, scope, technical notes - under 60 lines, no implementation furniture. Promote before implementation |
| `scripts/artifact.py promote --id <ID>` | Promote a planning-tier artifact to the full template (adds the deferred sections; idempotent) |
| `scripts/artifact.py batch --type <type> --count N` | Reserve an id range and write N pre-wired scaffolds atomically (fan-out authoring); implies `--template full` |
| `scripts/next_id.py allocate --type <type>` | The next collision-free id for a type (what `new`/`batch`/`file_finding` call internally; `--remote` also considers `origin/main`) |
| `scripts/artifact.py close --id <ID> --verdict approve` | Terminal-transition an artifact and record run telemetry |
| `scripts/provenance.py check` / `remake` | Flag artifacts that were not created by the tool (advisory; `provenance.enforce` to gate); backfill the stamp |
| `scripts/telemetry.py show` | Per-run outcomes (iterations, wall-time, stages, critic verdict) - local only, gitignored |

### Discovery Track (Issue, refine, triage)

The Discovery backlog (RFCs, CRs, Issues) is decomposed into the Delivery backlog: a request is
**refined** into an epic + stories; an Issue is **triaged** into bugs. Under `two_backlog.enforce`,
`sprint plan` refuses a Discovery item and its terminal status derives from its children.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/sdlc-studio issue create` | File a defect-side Discovery item (raw report; Severity + Size, no points) |
| `/sdlc-studio refine show --request CR-0001` | Show a request's content and confirm it is refinable (accepts an already-decomposed one, to inform an `add`) |

| `/sdlc-studio project implement --resume EP0003` | Resume from specific epic |

**State tracking:** `story implement` creates `sdlc-studio/workflows/WF{NNNN}.md` to track progress across sessions. `project implement` creates `sdlc-studio/.local/project-state.json` for cross-epic progress.

### Utilities

Skill-internal helpers live in the skill's `scripts/` directory (`$CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR/scripts/`, see `reference-scripts.md#skill-dir`). Claude invokes these on behalf of workflows; users do not call them directly. See `reference-scripts.md` for the full catalogue.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/sdlc-studio repo map build` | Index the repository symbols and imports |
| `/sdlc-studio repo map build --ignore vendor` | Skip an extra directory during indexing |
| `/sdlc-studio repo map query --story US0001` | Rank files by relevance to a story |
| `/sdlc-studio repo map query --story "auth flow"` | Rank files by a free-text query |
| `/sdlc-studio repo map stats` | Index size and top-10 hub files |

### Lessons (cross-project)

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/sdlc-studio lessons recall` | Surface relevant cross-project lessons before a decision |
| `/sdlc-studio lessons add --global` | Promote a lesson that generalises beyond this repo to the skill's `lessons/` (needs `skill_source_repo`) |
| `/sdlc-studio lessons list` | Print accumulated project lessons (`.local/lessons.md`) |
| `/sdlc-studio lessons add` | Append a new lesson to `.local/lessons.md` (**the default tier**) |
| `/sdlc-studio lessons prune --older EP0003` | Drop entries for old epics |
| `/sdlc-studio lessons revalidate` | List open lessons with their validity horizon; `--close` / `--extend` / `--stamp` them (gated at the sprint close) |
| `/sdlc-studio lessons summary` | Regenerate `retros/LESSONS-SUMMARY.md`, the digest the next sprint reads (gated at the sprint close) |
| `/sdlc-studio lessons rank` | Rank the cross-project lessons by what is biting hardest now (recurrence, recency; a guarded class is demoted) |

### Retro

The **adapt** half of inspect-and-adapt: what the sprint taught, and what you will do about
it. The close gate reads the retro's content, not its filename - see `help/retro.md`.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/sdlc-studio retro create` | Write the retro for the batch just closed (`artifact new --type retro`) |
| `/sdlc-studio retro validate` | Content check: required sections, a real lesson, every finding dispositioned (what the close gate calls) |
| `/sdlc-studio retro dispose` | List each finding as filed, declined, or still undecided |
| `/sdlc-studio retro extract` | Lift the retro's `## Lessons` into the project lessons log, so the next sprint plan reads them |

Every finding takes a disposition: **filed** (a `BG`/`CR` id) or **declined with a reason**.
Both are green - honesty costs exactly what noise costs. Silence does not pass.

### Plan Files

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/sdlc-studio plan list` | Show active Claude Code plan files (`--all`, `--stale`) |
| `/sdlc-studio plan archive {slug}` | Move a plan to `archive/{yyyy-mm}/` |

### External Integrations

Two-way sync between local records and external trackers. v1.6.0 ships GitHub Issues; Linear, Jira, and GitHub Projects board integration are deferred. Requires `gh` CLI installed and authenticated. See `reference-github-sync.md`.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/sdlc-studio cr sync` | Push + pull CRs to/from GitHub Issues |
| `/sdlc-studio story sync` | Push + pull Stories to/from GitHub Issues |
| `/sdlc-studio project sync` | Sync all three types (cr, story, epic) |
| `/sdlc-studio project sync push --type all` | Push only |
| `/sdlc-studio project sync pull --type cr` | Pull only |
| `/sdlc-studio project sync cascade` | Merged-PR cascade candidates |
| `/sdlc-studio project sync cascade --since <iso>` | Limit PR window |
| `/sdlc-studio project sync state` | Print sync state file |

## Typical Workflows

### Quick Start

```text
/sdlc-studio status                                # see full pipeline state
/sdlc-studio sprint --crs Proposed --goal done # drive a tranche (recommended)
/sdlc-studio hint                                  # or get a single next step by hand
```

### Greenfield Project (Manual)

```text
/sdlc-studio init                                  # step 1: folder tree, indexes, config, agent-instructions
/sdlc-studio prd create
/sdlc-studio trd create
/sdlc-studio persona
/sdlc-studio epic
/sdlc-studio story
/sdlc-studio tsd
/sdlc-studio test-spec
/sdlc-studio test-automation
```

Per-story you choose TDD or Test-After. Both paths produce the same artifacts, in different order:

### Brownfield Project (Manual)

```text
/sdlc-studio prd generate
/sdlc-studio trd generate
/sdlc-studio persona generate
/sdlc-studio epic
/sdlc-studio story
/sdlc-studio tsd generate
/sdlc-studio test-spec generate
/sdlc-studio test-automation
```

Flow: `prd generate → trd generate → persona generate → epic → story generate → test-spec → test-automation → code test (VALIDATE)`

**Critical:** The `code test` step validates specs against reality. Not optional.

### Automated Workflow (Recommended)

**Tranche level - sprint (the recommended default).** Drive a whole prioritised batch
to a goal in one autonomous loop, with a triage approval up front and a reconcile + review at
the end:

```text
/sdlc-studio sprint --crs Proposed --goal done
        │
triage plan + STOP for approval
        │
per unit: decompose → TDD wave → verify → conformance → independent critic → green commit
        │
closing gate: reconcile + sprint review + final report
```

For finer control, drop to the story or epic level below.

At story level:

```text

PRD → TRD → Personas → Epics → Stories
                                  │
                          story plan --story US0001
                                  │
                          story implement --story US0001
                                  │
                          (all 8 phases run automatically)
```

Or at the epic level with autonomous execution:

```text

epic plan --epic EP0001 --agentic
        │
(analyses dependencies → assigns concurrent waves)
        │
epic implement --epic EP0001 --agentic
        │
Wave 1: [US0001, US0003] concurrent
Wave 2: [US0002, US0004] concurrent
Wave 3: [US0005] sequential (hub file conflict)
```

`--agentic` analyses the dependency graph and hub file overlap to identify stories that can safely execute concurrently. Falls back to sequential for any stories with shared file conflicts.

**Workflow phases per story:**

1. Plan (code plan)
2. Test Spec (test-spec)
3. Tests (test-automation)
4. Implement (code implement)
5. Test (code test)
6. Verify (code verify)
7. Check (code check)
8. Review (status review)

### Project Implementation (Full PRD)

```text
/sdlc-studio project plan --agentic              # Preview execution order
/sdlc-studio project implement --agentic --no-artifacts  # Implement all epics
```

```text

project implement --agentic --no-artifacts
        │
EP0001: epic implement --agentic → commit → reconcile
EP0002: epic implement --agentic → commit → reconcile
EP0003: epic implement --agentic → commit → reconcile → review (every 3 epics)
...
Final: review → reconcile → report
```

**Quality gates enforced at every boundary:**

- Wave: typecheck + test suite
- Epic: reconcile + status cascade + commit
- Every 3 epics: quick review
- Project: full review + reconcile + code check

See `reference-project.md` for the full workflow.

### Epic Implementation

```text
/sdlc-studio epic plan --epic EP0002 --agentic   # Preview wave analysis
/sdlc-studio epic implement --epic EP0002 --agentic  # Implement one epic
```

### Story Implementation

```text
/sdlc-studio story plan --story US0001           # Create plan + test-spec
/sdlc-studio story implement --story US0001      # Execute 8-phase workflow
```

### Development Cycle (Manual)

```text
/sdlc-studio code plan           # Plan story (status -> Planned)
/sdlc-studio code implement      # Execute plan (status -> In Progress)
/sdlc-studio code test           # Run tests
/sdlc-studio code verify         # Verify AC (status -> Review)
/sdlc-studio code check          # Run linters (status -> Done)
```

Status: `Draft/Ready → Planned → In Progress → Review → Done`

### Daily Usage

```text
/sdlc-studio hint                # What should I do next?
/sdlc-studio status              # Full pipeline overview
/sdlc-studio status --brief      # Quick: Requirements 85% | Code 90% | Tests 94%
/sdlc-studio code plan           # Plan next story
```

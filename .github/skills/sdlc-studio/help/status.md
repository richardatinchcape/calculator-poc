# /sdlc-studio status

Shows a visual dashboard of project health across three pillars: Requirements, Code, and Tests.

## You can just ask

SDLC Studio is model-invoked - say it in plain language:

| Just say... | Runs |
| --- | --- |
| "How is the project doing?" | `/sdlc-studio status` |
| "Give me the one-line summary" | `/sdlc-studio status --brief` |
| "Refresh the numbers after that test run" | `/sdlc-studio status --full` |
| "How is test coverage looking?" | `/sdlc-studio status --testing` |
| "What's in flight right now?" | `/sdlc-studio status --workflows` |
| "What's left in the backlog?" | `python3 "$CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR/scripts/status.py" backlog` |
| "What should I do next?" | `/sdlc-studio hint` |

> **Deterministic helper.** Compute the census with the script rather than reading every artifact:
> `python3 "$CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR/scripts/status.py" pillars --format json`.
> Render the dashboard from that JSON. Run live lint / type-check / coverage yourself - the
> script reports artifact-derived state only.
>
> If `sdlc-studio/rfcs/` exists, optionally surface a one-line **Design Exploration** count under Requirements (e.g. `🧭 RFCs: 1 Draft, 0 In Review` – open design questions awaiting a decision). RFCs are pre-CR exploration and do not gate pipeline health; the line is informational only.

## Usage

```bash
/sdlc-studio status              # Quick status (uses cache if available)
/sdlc-studio status --full       # Full refresh, updates cache
/sdlc-studio status --testing    # Testing pillar only
/sdlc-studio status --workflows  # Workflow state only
/sdlc-studio status --brief      # One-line summary
```

## Pre-flight: Version Check

**First tool call:** `Glob: sdlc-studio/.version` (the schema may also live in
`sdlc-studio/.config.yaml` - a fresh v3 project has only the config file)

| Result | Action |
| --- | --- |
| No sdlc-studio/ directory | Proceed (new project) |
| `schema_version` 2 or 3 (in .version or .config.yaml) | Proceed (current schemas) |
| Both absent, or `schema_version` < 2 | Check `sdlc-studio/.local/upgrade-dismissed.json` |
| └─ dismissed: true | Proceed |
| └─ not dismissed | Prompt user (see below) |

**Prompt if needed:**

```text
question: "Project uses a superseded artefact schema. Upgrade to the current one?"
header: "Upgrade"
options:
  - "Preview" → run upgrade --dry-run, then continue
  - "Not now" → continue
  - "Don't ask again" → write dismissal file, continue
```

**Output prefix:** Start response with `**Schema:** v2 ✓` / `**Schema:** v3 ✓` or
`**Schema:** superseded (reason)`

## Visual Dashboard

The status command displays an at-a-glance dashboard with four pillars:

```text
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                      SDLC STATUS
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

📋 REQUIREMENTS (PRD Status)        ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░ 85%

## Four Pillars

### 📋 Requirements (PRD Status)

Tracks specification completeness:

| Metric | Source | Calculation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PRD | `sdlc-studio/prd.md` | Exists + feature count |
| Personas | `sdlc-studio/personas.md` | Count defined |
| Epics | `sdlc-studio/epics/EP*.md` | % in Ready/Done status |
| Stories | `sdlc-studio/stories/US*.md` | % in Done status |

**Health score:** Weighted average (PRD 20%, Personas 10%, Epics 30%, Stories 40%)

**Exemptions:** Project-level documents (PRD, TRD, TSD, Personas, Brand Guide) are exempt from lifecycle status checks. See `reference-outputs.md` → [Project-Level Document Exemptions](../reference-outputs.md#project-level-exemptions).

### 💻 Code (TRD Status)

Tracks implementation quality:

| Metric | Source | Calculation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TRD | `sdlc-studio/trd.md` | Exists |
| Lint | `ruff check` / `npm run lint` | Pass/Fail |
| TODOs | Grep source directories | Count of TODO/FIXME |
| Type check | `mypy` / `tsc --noEmit` | Pass/Fail (if configured) |

**Health score:** TRD exists 30%, Lint pass 35%, No critical TODOs 35%

### 🧪 Tests (TSD Status)

Tracks test coverage and quality:

| Metric | Source | Calculation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TSD | `sdlc-studio/tsd.md` | Exists |
| Backend coverage | `.coverage` or TSD | Actual % vs 90% target |
| Frontend coverage | `coverage/lcov.info` or TSD | Actual % vs 90% target |
| E2E features | `e2e/*.spec.ts` | Spec files vs features |

**Health score:** TSD 10%, Backend coverage 30%, Frontend coverage 30%, E2E coverage 30%

### 🔍 Reviews

Tracks review currency and findings:

| Metric | Primary Source | Fallback Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PRD reviewed | `.local/review-state.json` | Scan `sdlc-studio/reviews/RV*.md` for PRD/unified reviews |
| TRD reviewed | `.local/review-state.json` | Scan `sdlc-studio/reviews/RV*.md` for TRD/unified reviews |
| TSD reviewed | `.local/review-state.json` | Scan `sdlc-studio/reviews/RV*.md` for TSD/unified reviews |
| Epics current | `.local/review-state.json` | Scan `sdlc-studio/reviews/RV*-ep*.md` for cascade reviews |
| Stories current | `.local/review-state.json` | Epic cascade reviews cover stories |
| Open findings | `sdlc-studio/reviews/` | Parse `> **Status:**` in review files |

**IMPORTANT - Fallback when review-state.json is missing:**

If `.local/review-state.json` does not exist, the status dashboard MUST NOT report 0% reviews. Instead:

1. Glob `sdlc-studio/reviews/RV*.md` to discover existing review files
2. Parse each file's `> **Date:**` header for the review timestamp
3. Match reviews to artifacts:
   - Files containing "unified" or "prd" or "trd" or "tsd" in title → document reviews
   - Files containing `ep{NNNN}` in filename → epic cascade reviews
4. Compare review dates against artifact modification dates (via git log)
5. Report findings based on discovered reviews
6. **Recommend creating review-state.json** by running `/sdlc-studio review` to establish proper tracking

**Health score calculation:**

```text
Review Health % =
  PRD reviewed (10%)
  + TRD reviewed (10%)
  + TSD reviewed (10%)
  + Epics with current reviews (40%)
  + Stories with current reviews (30%)
  × Stale penalty (0.9 if anything needs re-review)
```

**Stale detection:**

An artifact needs re-review when:

- Artifact file modified since last review
- Code files modified since last review (stories)
- No review exists

**Findings indicators:**

| Indicator | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| ✅ Reviewed (date) | Reviewed and current |
| ⚠️ N stories changed | Stories modified since epic review |
| ⚠️ N critical findings | Unaddressed critical issues |
| ❌ Never reviewed | No review record exists |

## Status Indicators

| Indicator | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| ✅ | Complete / Passing / On target |
| ⚠️ | Partial / Warning / Below target |
| ❌ | Missing / Failing / Critical gap |

## Progress Bars

Progress bars use 10 characters, right-aligned with percentage:

```text
▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ 100%
▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░ 90%
▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░ 80%
▓▓▓▓▓░░░░░ 50%
░░░░░░░░░░ 0%
```

## Next Steps Prioritisation

Next steps are prioritised by impact:

1. **Missing foundations** - PRD, TRD, TSD not created
2. **Blocking items** - Epics blocking stories, failing tests
3. **Below-target coverage** - Coverage under 90%
4. **Quality issues** - Lint failures, TODOs
5. **Automation gaps** - Test specs without automation

## Suggested Command

The dashboard includes a suggested `/sdlc-studio` command based on the highest-priority next step:

| Next Step Type | Suggested Command |
| --- | --- |
| Missing PRD | `/sdlc-studio prd create` or `prd generate` |
| Missing TRD | `/sdlc-studio trd create` or `trd generate` |
| Missing TSD | `/sdlc-studio tsd create` |
| Epic incomplete | `/sdlc-studio epic review --epic {id}` |
| Stories ready | `/sdlc-studio story implement --story {id}` |
| Lint failures | `/sdlc-studio code review` |
| Test failures | `/sdlc-studio test-spec review` |
| Coverage gaps | `/sdlc-studio test-automation generate` |

The command maps directly to the first item in NEXT STEPS. For detailed guidance, use `/sdlc-studio hint`.

## Workflow Status

With `--workflows` flag, shows active and paused workflows:

```text
Workflows:
  Active      1 story workflow (US0024 - phase 5/8)
  Paused      0
  Completed   7 story workflows, 1 epic workflow

Resume:
  /sdlc-studio story implement --story US0024 --from-phase 5
```

## Brief Mode

With `--brief` flag, shows single-line summary:

```text
SDLC: 📋 85% | 💻 90% | 🧪 94% | 🔍 80% | ▶️ /sdlc-studio epic review --epic EP0001
```

## Data Sources

| Data | Primary Source | Fallback |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Coverage % | `.coverage`, `coverage/lcov.info` | Parse from TSD |
| Lint status | Run lint command | Skip if no config |
| TODO count | Grep source dirs | Show "unknown" |
| Feature count | Parse PRD headings | Count "##" sections |

**Note:** Coverage data may be stale if tests haven't run recently. The dashboard will indicate when coverage data is older than source file changes.

## When to Use

- **Session start** - See what needs attention
- **After changes** - Verify progress
- **Before commit** - Check all pillars healthy
- **Onboarding** - Understand project state

## Caching

For large projects, status uses cached results by default:

| Mode | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| Default (quick) | Uses cached results if available, shows timestamp |
| `--full` | Runs fresh analysis, updates cache |

Cache location: `sdlc-studio/.local/status-cache.json`

**When to use `--full`:**

- After running tests or lint
- After significant code changes
- When cache is stale (more than a few hours old)

**Quick mode still updates:**

- PRD/TRD/TSD existence checks (fast)
- Epic/Story status markers (fast file reads)

**Quick mode caches:**

- Lint results (slow command execution)
- TODO counts (slow grep across codebase)
- Coverage percentages (slow parsing)
- Test counts (slow parsing)

## Index Reconciliation

The `--full` status check includes index reconciliation to detect drift between files and indexes:

### What it checks

1. **Missing index entries:** Glob `sdlc-studio/plans/PL*.md` and `sdlc-studio/test-specs/TS*.md`, compare with entries in `_index.md`. Report files that exist but have no index entry.

2. **Status mismatches:** For each indexed artifact, compare the status in the index table with the `> **Status:**` header in the actual file. Flag any discrepancies.

3. **Stale statuses:** Cross-reference story status with linked plan/test-spec/workflow status. If a story is in any terminal status (Done, Won't Implement, Deferred, Superseded) but its plan, test spec, or workflow is still in a non-terminal status (Draft/In Progress/Ready/Created), flag it as stale. See `reference-outputs.md` → [Story Completion Cascade](../reference-outputs.md#story-completion-cascade) for the expected target statuses.

4. **ID collisions:** Detect multiple files sharing the same ID prefix (e.g., `PL0184-*.md` matching two files). Report these for resolution.

### Output format

If issues are found, add an INTEGRITY section to the dashboard:

```text
🔗 INTEGRITY                        ⚠️ Issues found
   ⚠️ 3 plans missing from index
   ⚠️ 2 test specs with stale status (story Done, spec Draft)
   ⚠️ 1 ID collision (PL0184)
```

### Why this matters

Without reconciliation, indexes drift over time as artifacts are created during workflows but index updates are skipped or fail. This produces misleading dashboard counts and phantom entries in status reports.

## Reconcile Recommendation Line {#reconcile-recommendation}

`/sdlc-studio status` reads `sdlc-studio/.local/reconcile-state.json` and emits a one-line recommendation when one or more reconcile-cadence triggers fired since the last reconcile. Triggers are defined in `reference-reconcile.md#cadence-triggers`:

- Epic close (`Status → Done`)
- Ship event (tagged release / merge to main)
- CR `action` (CR → Epic+Stories generation)
- More than 7 days since last reconcile

When any trigger is open, status appends:

```text
ℹ️  Reconcile recommended because: epic EP0042 closed, v3.55.3 shipped (2 triggers since last reconcile)
   Run: /sdlc-studio reconcile
```

The recommendation is advisory – it doesn't block any other workflow. Reconcile is cheap and idempotent; running it more often than strictly necessary is harmless. The cost of skipping a recommended reconcile is silent drift that surfaces later as a review finding or, worse, an inconsistent ship.

If `reconcile-state.json` does not exist (project hasn't yet adopted the cadence triggers), the recommendation line is suppressed and no error is emitted.

A persistent `count-mismatch` that `reconcile apply` does not clear is usually an
out-of-vocab status: the finding names the offending status, its artifacts, and the
`status_vocab.<type>` config remedy directly - see
`reference-reconcile.md#count-mismatch-diagnosis` and `scripts/validate.py check`.

# /sdlc-studio consult - Persona Consultation

## You can just ask

SDLC Studio is model-invoked - say it in plain language:

| Just say... | Runs |
| --- | --- |
| "Get the team to review the PRD" | `/sdlc-studio consult team sdlc-studio/prd.md` |
| "What would Sarah think of this story?" | `/sdlc-studio consult sarah-chen sdlc-studio/stories/US0001.md` |
| "Ask all the stakeholders about this before we ship" | `/sdlc-studio consult stakeholders prd.md` |
| "Give me a quick gut-check on this epic" | `/sdlc-studio consult team epic.md --quick` |
| "Have engineering and QA pull this spec apart" | `/sdlc-studio consult team auth-spec.md --thorough` |

> **Source of truth:** `reference-consult.md` - Detailed workflow steps

Get structured feedback from personas on SDLC artefacts.

## Quick Reference

```bash
/sdlc-studio consult [persona] [artefact]     # Single persona feedback
/sdlc-studio consult team [artefact]          # Three Amigos review
/sdlc-studio consult stakeholders [artefact]  # All stakeholder personas
/sdlc-studio consult all [artefact]           # Everyone
```

## How It Works

1. Claude loads the persona's full profile (goals, concerns, decision style)
2. Reviews the artefact "in character" as that persona
3. Returns structured feedback with verdict, questions, and conditions

**Key Difference from `/sdlc-studio chat`:**

- `consult` = Automated, structured output, no back-and-forth
- `chat` = Interactive conversation, follow-up questions

---

## Actions

### Single Persona

```bash
/sdlc-studio consult sarah-chen sdlc-studio/prd.md
```

Get feedback from one specific persona.

**Output:**

```markdown
## Sarah Chen (Product Manager)
**Verdict:** ⚠️ Concerns

"The problem statement is solid, but I'm not seeing clear
success metrics. How will we measure if this feature is working?"

**Questions:**
- What's our baseline for current user behaviour?
- Have we validated this with user research?

**Conditions for approval:**
- Add measurable success criteria
```

### Team (Three Amigos)

```bash
/sdlc-studio consult team sdlc-studio/prd.md
```

Get feedback from Product, Engineering, and QA perspectives.

**Default representatives:**

- Product: First Product persona or Sarah Chen
- Engineering: First Senior Engineer or Marcus Johnson
- QA: First QA persona or Priya Sharma

**Override defaults:**

```bash
/sdlc-studio consult team prd.md --engineering nadia-okonkwo
```

### Stakeholders

```bash
/sdlc-studio consult stakeholders sdlc-studio/prd.md
```

Get feedback from all stakeholder personas (Users, Business, Technical).

### All

```bash
/sdlc-studio consult all sdlc-studio/prd.md
```

Get feedback from Team AND Stakeholders. Most comprehensive but highest cost.

## Cost Considerations

| --------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| Single persona | Low | Targeted feedback |

| Stakeholders | Medium-High | User-facing changes |
| All | High | Major decisions, releases |

**Tips:**

```bash
/sdlc-studio persona create    # Create interactively
/sdlc-studio persona generate  # Generate from PRD/code
```

## Next Steps

After consultation:

- Address concerns raised by personas

# SDLC Studio Reference - Workflow Persona Integration

How personas integrate across all SDLC Studio workflows.

<!-- Load when: Understanding persona integration patterns -->

---

## Overview

Personas can be consulted at key decision points throughout the SDLC pipeline. This reference describes when persona consultation adds value, when to skip it, and how to control integration behaviour.

> **The Three Amigos are your own personal engineering team.** Engineering, QA, and Product ship as
> rich, instantiated **amigo cards** (`templates/personas/amigos/`) - specific, skilled people
> (Dani, Sam, Lena) with goals, proficiency, a working method, and an honest **Shadow** - built by
> fusing Cooper goal-directed depth with seat discipline (`templates/personas/amigo-template.md`,
> RFC0020). They both **do** the work (a build / author / test render) and **review** it (a review
> render) - always as separate instances, so a seat never signs off its own work. **Edit them to
> suit your project**, or author a more specialised practitioner amigo that overrides a default; the
> richer and more project-specific the amigo, the more it is worth.
>
> Each is still consulted as an **independent subagent** with a synthesis step (see
> `reference-consult.md`). The amigos are distinct from the Cooper goal-directed **design personas**
> (who the product is *for*) - design personas describe users and are the **target/lens** the amigos
> work toward; the amigos are the team that does and reviews the work. There is one seat schema:
> `amigo-template.md` (the enriched seat schema) covers both a build-capable amigo and a pure-review
> document-owner seat below - a review-only seat fills its review render and marks the work-render
> sections "n/a".
>
> **The adversarial critic is a seat, not an anonymous instance.** The sprint-close
> full-diff critic pass runs AS the QA seat's review render (resolved via
> `persona_resolve`; the QA amigo is the default): the card's Lens and
> Pushes-Back-When list are the critic's attack angles, and the verdict is
> recorded under the seat's name so `critic-verdicts.md` reads as the seat's
> sign-off. `critic.py record` warns when a reviewer matches no declared seat.

### Document-owner seats

Two seats are **accountable** for a top-level requirements document - they carry the "are the
requirements actually met?" question into every review of work derived from it:

| Seat | Owns | Accountable for | Applies |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Product Owner** | the **PRD** | PRD requirements are complete, current, and **satisfied** by the work; signs the PRD review leg | every project |
| **Product Manager** | the **PVD** | PVD product requirements are satisfied and each maps to a child PRD; signs the PVD review leg | **only when a PVD exists** (`sdlc-studio/product/pvd.md`) |

A single-repo project has no PVD: it runs with the Product Owner only. The Product Manager seat (and
the PVD review) is needed once several repos form one product and a PVD coordinates them
(`reference-pvd.md`) - absent a PVD, neither applies.

### Refine and triage: the baked-in consult

`refine` and `triage` are the decomposition ceremonies where a Discovery item's open questions get
answered, so the Three Amigos are baked into them rather than left as an informal step. When an
`--question` is passed, the ceremony resolves the panel to the actual **named seats** (via the same
declared-role chain a delegated worker uses - project seat, else the shipped default), attaches each
seat's review-render framing, and surfaces the questions to that panel. The lead differs by
ceremony: `refine` is **engineering-led** (a request is largely a build breakdown), `triage` is
**QA-led** (is it reproducible? what is the real defect?).

The consult leaves an audit trail: the request/Issue gets a `> **Consulted:**` metadata line (the
named seats + date) and an `## Amigo Consult` section listing the questions, written idempotently.
`--skip-personas` forces the generic path - no seats resolved, no framing, byte-equivalent - and a
project seat card that claims a role but lacks its review render is a hard error, caught **before**
anything is minted (the ceremony fails empty rather than half-decomposing). The panel resolution and
the independence floor (a seat never signs off its own work) are the same ones the author≠reviewer
critic gate holds. Resolve a panel directly with `persona_resolve.py panel --ceremony refine|triage`.

## Per-Workflow Integration

## PRD Workflows {#prd-integration}

### PRD Create

**When:** After step 6 (Write PRD)

**Default:** Prompt user - "Would you like Three Amigos review?"

**Rationale:** PRD is the foundation. Catching issues here is 10-100x cheaper than fixing later.

**Personas consulted:**

- Sarah Chen (PO) - Requirements completeness
- Marcus Johnson (Senior Dev) - Technical feasibility
- Priya Sharma (QA Lead) - Testability

**Integration:**

```bash
# With persona consultation (explicit)
/sdlc-studio prd create --with-personas

# Skip consultation
/sdlc-studio prd create --skip-personas

# Default: prompts after draft
/sdlc-studio prd create
```

### PRD Generate

**When:** After step 5 (Write PRD)

**Default:** Strongly recommend consultation

**Rationale:** Generated PRDs may have inferred requirements that need human validation. Personas catch assumptions.

**Personas consulted:**

- Team (Three Amigos) - Always
- Relevant stakeholders based on PRD content

### PRD Review

**When:** After step 5 (Report Changes) - only if significant changes found

**Default:** Prompt if changes found

**Triggers for consultation:**

- New features discovered
- Features marked as broken
- Scope changes identified

---

## Epic Workflows {#epic-integration}

### Epic Create

**When:** After step 6 (Report)

**Default:** Always (Three Amigos)

**Rationale:** Epics define scope boundaries and technical approach. Three Amigos ensure requirements completeness (PO), technical feasibility (Eng), and testability (QA). Affected stakeholder personas provide additional domain-specific feedback.

**Personas consulted:**

- **Sarah Chen (PO):** Validates scope, success metrics, user value, and feature boundaries
- **Marcus Johnson (Eng):** Reviews TRD alignment, architecture impact, dependency graph, and technical risks
- **Priya Sharma (QA):** Assesses testability, edge case coverage, TSD alignment, and quality gates
- Personas mentioned in epic's "Affected Personas" section (additional)

**Integration:**

```bash
# Default: Three Amigos consultation runs automatically
/sdlc-studio epic

# Skip consultation
/sdlc-studio epic --skip-personas

# Consult specific stakeholder in addition to Three Amigos
/sdlc-studio epic --persona david-park
```

### Epic Review

**When:** During cascading review

**Default:** Optional (prompt) - Three Amigos when enabled

**Enable with:** `--with-personas` flag

---

## Story Workflows {#story-integration}

### Story Create

**When:** After step 8 (Cohesion Review)

**Default:** Always (Three Amigos)

**Rationale:** Stories define the implementation contract. Three Amigos ensure completeness (PO), technical alignment (Eng), and testability (QA). Each amigo reviews from their professional perspective against the relevant source documents.

**Personas consulted:**

- **Sarah Chen (PO):** Validates user value, AC completeness, persona alignment, and that the story addresses the right user problem
- **Marcus Johnson (Eng):** Reviews TRD alignment, technical notes accuracy, dependency correctness, and that implementation guidance is feasible
- **Priya Sharma (QA):** Assesses AC testability, edge case completeness, TSD alignment, and that test scenarios cover the risk profile

**Integration:**

```bash
# Default: Three Amigos consultation runs automatically
/sdlc-studio story

# Skip consultation
/sdlc-studio story --skip-personas

# Validate specific story only
/sdlc-studio story --story US0001 --with-personas
```

### Story Plan

**When:** After plan creation (code plan)

**Default:** Always (Three Amigos)

**Rationale:** Plans define the implementation approach. Three Amigos ensure the approach is sound before coding begins.

**Personas consulted:**

- **Sarah Chen (PO):** Validates scope alignment, that plan addresses all ACs, and no scope creep
- **Marcus Johnson (Eng):** Reviews implementation approach, architecture alignment, edge case handling plan
- **Priya Sharma (QA):** Validates test strategy recommendation (TDD vs Test-After), test coverage plan

**Integration:**

```bash
# Default: Three Amigos review runs automatically after plan creation
/sdlc-studio code plan --story US0001

# Skip consultation
/sdlc-studio code plan --story US0001 --skip-personas
```

### Story Review

**When:** On status transitions

**Default:** Optional (prompt) - Three Amigos when enabled

**Rationale:** Useful for significant transitions (Ready, Review, Done) but too frequent for every status change.

**Enable selectively:**

```bash
# Three Amigos review of a specific story
/sdlc-studio consult team sdlc-studio/stories/US0001.md

# Single persona review
/sdlc-studio consult priya-sharma sdlc-studio/stories/US0001.md
```

### Bug Fix

**When:** After root cause analysis (bug fix step 4)

**Default:** Always (Three Amigos)

**Rationale:** Bug fixes need multi-perspective review: user impact assessment (PO), root cause validation and fix approach review (Eng), and regression test planning (QA).

**Personas consulted:**

- **Sarah Chen (PO):** Assesses user impact, validates fix priority against roadmap
- **Marcus Johnson (Eng):** Reviews root cause analysis, validates fix approach, checks for architectural implications
- **Priya Sharma (QA):** Plans regression tests, identifies related test scenarios, assesses risk of fix introducing new issues

**Integration:**

```bash
# Default: Three Amigos consultation runs after root cause analysis
/sdlc-studio bug fix --bug BG0001

# Skip consultation
/sdlc-studio bug fix --bug BG0001 --skip-personas
```

---

## Technical Workflows {#technical-integration}

### TRD Create/Generate

**When:** After TRD draft

**Default:** Off

**Rationale:** TRD is technical; most personas aren't relevant.

**Enable for:**

- Security Lead (David Park) - If security-sensitive
- DevOps (Chris Morgan) - If infrastructure changes

```bash
/sdlc-studio trd create --persona david-park
```

### Spec Review

**When:** Before implementation

**Default:** Off

**Enable for:**

- Engineering team review of complex designs

## Cost Considerations {#cost}

## When Consultation Adds Most Value

| Scenario | Value | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| New project PRD | HIGH | Always consult (Three Amigos) |
| Major scope change | HIGH | Consult team (Three Amigos) |
| User-facing feature | HIGH | Consult user personas + Three Amigos |
| Epic creation | HIGH | Always consult (Three Amigos + stakeholders) |
| Story creation | HIGH | Always consult (Three Amigos) |
| Story planning | HIGH | Always consult (Three Amigos) |
| Bug fixes | HIGH | Always consult (Three Amigos: impact, root cause, regression) |
| Internal tooling | MEDIUM | Three Amigos (quick mode) |
| Refactoring | LOW | Skip or quick mode |

## Cost Reduction Strategies

1. **Use `--quick` for iterations**
   - Full consultation on final review only
   - Quick mode during drafts

2. **Use `--relevant` to auto-filter**
   - Only consults personas relevant to artefact
   - Reduces token usage

3. **Batch consultations**
   - Consult once after generating multiple stories
   - Rather than per-story

4. **Skip for low-risk changes**
   - Documentation updates
   - Minor bug fixes
   - Internal refactoring

---

## Automatic vs Manual Consultation

## Automatic (Built into Workflow)

Workflows prompt for consultation at appropriate points:

```text
PRD draft complete.

Would you like Three Amigos review of this PRD?
  [Yes] - Run /sdlc-studio consult team prd.md
  [No] - Skip persona consultation
  [Later] - I'll run it manually when ready
```

## Manual (User-Initiated)

User can run consultation at any time:

```bash
# Consult any persona on any artefact
/sdlc-studio consult sarah-chen sdlc-studio/prd.md

# Team review
/sdlc-studio consult team sdlc-studio/epics/EP0001.md

# All stakeholders
/sdlc-studio consult stakeholders sdlc-studio/prd.md
```

---

## Persona Relevance Mapping

## Which Personas for Which Artefacts

| Artefact Type | Primary Personas | Secondary Personas |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PRD | Product Owner, End Users | Executive, Security |
| TRD | Senior Dev, Architect | DevOps, Security |
| Epic | Three Amigos (PO, Eng, QA) | Affected stakeholders |
| Story | Three Amigos (PO, Eng, QA) | Story persona |
| Plan | Three Amigos (PO, Eng, QA) | - |
| Bug | Three Amigos (PO, Eng, QA) | Affected story persona |
| Test Strategy | QA Lead, QA Team | Senior Dev |
| Technical Spec | Engineering Team | Security, Compliance |

## Auto-Selection Logic

When using `--relevant` or automatic consultation:

1. **Artefact type mapping** (above table)
2. **Content analysis** - Personas mentioned in artefact
3. **Domain matching** - Persona expertise vs artefact domain
4. **Historical utility** - Previously useful feedback

---

## Configuration

## Project-Level Defaults

In `sdlc-studio/config.yaml`:

```yaml
personas:
  # Default consultation behaviour
  consult_on_prd: prompt      # always, prompt, never
  consult_on_epic: prompt
  consult_on_story: prompt

  # Default depth
  default_depth: standard     # quick, standard, thorough

  # Auto-filter by relevance
  auto_relevant: true

  # Minimum relevance score (0-100)
  relevance_threshold: 30
```

## Per-Command Override

Flags override project defaults:

```bash
# Override to always consult
/sdlc-studio prd create --with-personas

# Override to skip
/sdlc-studio story --skip-personas
```

Project-level configuration for customising SDLC Studio behaviour.

> `config-defaults.yaml` (in `templates/`) is the single source of truth for default values; the Default columns below mirror it and are guarded against drift by `scripts/tests/test_config.py`. Scripts read it via `scripts/config.py`. Project overrides go in `sdlc-studio/.config.yaml`.

## Configuration Files

| File | Location | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `config-defaults.yaml` | `templates/` (skill) | Default values (do not modify) |
| `.config.yaml` | `sdlc-studio/` (project) | Project-specific overrides |
| `.version` | `sdlc-studio/` (project) | Version tracking for upgrades |

## Configuration Loading

```text
1. Load templates/config-defaults.yaml (skill defaults)
2. Check for sdlc-studio/.config.yaml (project overrides)
3. Merge: project values override defaults
4. Use merged config for all commands
```

Project config only needs to specify values that differ from defaults.

**PyYAML dependency (graceful):** parsing `.config.yaml` needs PyYAML (`pip install pyyaml`).
Without it, the scripts do not crash: `config.get` degrades to the built-in default with a
one-line stderr warning, so a stdlib-only machine runs on the defaults. A project that ships a
`.config.yaml` should install PyYAML so its declared conventions are actually applied.

---

## Coverage Targets

Control test coverage thresholds used in TSD, status dashboard, and test specs.

| Setting | Default | Used In | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `unit` | 90 | TSD, status, test-spec | Core business logic coverage |
| `integration` | 85 | TSD | API and database interaction coverage |
| `e2e` | 100 | TSD, e2e-guidelines | Feature file coverage target |

**When to adjust:** lower for brownfield/legacy code (70-80% initially) or prototypes (60%); raise for critical systems (financial/medical may require 95%+).

---

## Story Quality Gates

Control minimum requirements for story readiness.

### Edge Cases

| Setting | Default | Used In |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `edge_cases.api` | 8 | story template, reference-story |
| `edge_cases.other` | 5 | reference-story, reference-decisions |

**API stories require more edge cases** because they handle input validation, authentication/authorisation, rate limiting, concurrent access, and network failures.

### Test Scenarios

| Setting | Default | Used In |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `test_scenarios.api` | 10 | story template |
| `test_scenarios.ui` | 8 | reference-story |

### Story Sizing

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `max_ac` | 10 | Story too large if > 10 AC |
| `max_points` | 13 | Story too large if > 13 points |
| `recommended_ac.min` | 3 | Suggest more AC if < 3 |
| `recommended_ac.max` | 5 | Optimal upper bound |

---

## Engagement Floor {#engagement-floor}

Default-on (NOT advisory): governs when the planning pass may be skipped.

| Setting | Default | Used In |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `engagement_floor` | `floor` | reference-doctrine rule 16, agent-instructions, `engagement_floor.py` |

`floor` (default): a multi-file change in a spec-bearing repo REQUIRES the planning pass - a spec delta naming each interacting requirement plus one acceptance criterion per interaction - before any code. This is the measured rule from the skill's 2026-07 benchmark rerun (judgement-gated engagement matched no-process on base models; the mandated pass cut escapes 4-5x for ~10-20% more tokens). `judgement`: the operator accepts that risk and restores pure scale-to-size judgement everywhere.

**Mechanically enforced** by the blocking `engagement-floor` gate lane (`engagement_floor.py`, see reference-scripts-verify): a shipped unit skips the planning pass only by planning (AC / `Verify:` / linked plan) or DECLARING a real single-file `Affects` path (prose like `n/a` does not count); a multi-file unit with no plan fails `unplanned`, one that neither plans nor declares fails `undeclared`. The guarantee is precise: pure omission is caught, and understatement is cross-checked by git in a solo-id commit. Understatement in a commit shared with another judged id was a disclosed limit, now closable with a `Refs: <id>` commit trailer: the git leg attributes a commit's files to each id its `Refs:` trailer names, so a shared commit becomes per-id attributable (a bare co-named subject is still skipped). See reference-scripts-verify for the trailer grammar. Two config shapes so mode and cutoff never collide - scalar `engagement_floor: judgement` opts out everywhere (lane reports, never blocks), or a mapping with `adopt_after:` (forward-only id cutoff; above the highest existing id is refused as a silent disarm) and optional `mode:`. `decisions.py waive --subject rule:engagement-floor[:<id>]` waives the project or one unit.

**Opt-in commit-msg gate.** A tracked `.githooks/commit-msg` hook REFUSES a commit whose subject names more than one work-item id without a `Refs:` trailer per owning id, so the floor can attribute the shared commit per id; it prints the exact trailer lines to paste, so the cost of enforcing is one retry. A single-id subject needs no trailer and passes, as do a merge, revert, cherry-pick, rebase replay, and `fixup!`/`squash!` - git wrote those messages, and the work they record was gated on its original commit. It is opt-in and never forced on a consuming project: this repo enables it with `bash tools/enable-hooks.sh` (it also carries the pre-commit gate); a consuming project opts in per project by pointing its own commit-msg hook at `engagement_floor.py check-commit-msg --strict` (drop `--strict` to warn instead of refuse). It degrades honestly - with no git, no script, or an unparseable message it exits without blocking. The one escape is `git commit --no-verify`.

---

## TDD Trigger

Control when TDD mode is recommended over Test-After.

| Setting | Default | Used In |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `edge_case_threshold` | 5 | reference-decisions, help/code |

**Rationale**: stories with many edge cases benefit from TDD - tests clarify expected behaviour before implementation, edge cases are hard to retrofit, and TDD prevents "happy path only" implementations.

---

## E2E Limits

Control when to split E2E spec files.

| Setting | Default | Used In |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `max_tests_per_spec` | 50 | reference-test-e2e-guidelines |

**Why 50?** Larger spec files take longer to run, are harder to parallelise, and make failures harder to isolate.

---

## Epic Perspectives

Available perspectives for epic breakdown.

```text
epic:
  perspectives:
    - engineering   # TRD-aligned (components, APIs, data)
    - product       # PRD-aligned (value, metrics, stakeholders)
    - test          # TSD-aligned (coverage, risk, automation)
```

Used by `/sdlc-studio epic --perspective {name}`.

---

## Review Configuration

Severity levels for review findings.

```text
review:
  severity_levels:
    - critical      # Must address before merge
    - important     # Should address
    - suggestion    # Consider addressing
```

---

## Persona Staleness {#personas-staleness-days}

The Persona Review pass of `/sdlc-studio review` uses this window to decide whether a persona is "stale" (no consult / story / CR reference within the window).

| Setting | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `staleness_days` | 90 | Days without a touch before a persona is flagged stale |

A project where personas are consulted rarely by design (e.g. stable archetypes) can extend this; a project where personas are expected to be high-touch can shorten it. See `reference-review.md` for the cross-doc check that reads this value.

---

## Lessons Validity {#lessons-validity}

| Setting | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lessons.validity_days` | 90 | Days from `Added:` to the `Review-by:` horizon stamped by `lessons add` |
| `lessons.loop` | `enforce` | The learning loop. `enforce` (default): the retro's content is checked and every finding dispositioned - filed, or declined with a reason. `judgement`: reports, never blocks. Same shape and reasoning as the engagement floor - a step gated on judgement is the step that gets skipped - but the claim that it cuts repeat defects is registered to be measured, not asserted. See `reference-doctrine.md` rule 17 |

At the sprint close, `gate --require-retro` (or `--require-lessons`) **fails** while an open lesson sits past its horizon: it is either closed (`lessons revalidate --close`, no longer true) or extended (`--extend`, still true). A lesson carrying no horizon at all fails the same lane - unprovable is not proven - and `revalidate --stamp` backfills one. Shorten the window on a fast-moving codebase where lessons rot quickly; lengthen it in a stable domain. See `reference-agentic-lessons.md#close-loop`.

```text
# sdlc-studio/.config.yaml
lessons:
  validity_days: 30
```

---

## Sprint Breakdown Gate {#breakdown}

| Setting | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sprint.breakdown` | `enforce` | Default-on, NOT advisory. `enforce`: `sprint plan` REFUSES a batch holding a unit that declares no `Affects` or no `Points:` - and refuses a unit above the split threshold, since above it the estimate is not worth having. It names each ungroomed unit, says what it lacks, and exits non-zero **without printing a plan** - a plan over unsized units is false authority. `judgement`: the lane reports and does not block, the same shape as the engagement floor and the lessons loop. Omission is not an escape - with no config at all the gate BLOCKS, and an unknown mode falls back to `enforce`. `sprint.py breakdown` reports the same census, read-only. See `reference-sprint.md#breakdown` |
| `sprint.split_above` | `8` | The `Points:` value above which the gate refuses a unit and demands it be split. A point is a stable unit of cost up to here and breaks beyond it, so above it decomposition is a triage decision, not an estimation one. Tighten to `5` for smaller units. |

---

## Sprint Capacity {#capacity}

How much ONE sprint may cost. The single source for both the plan-time "does this batch fit?" check and the run-time breaker's appetite, so the two cannot disagree.

| Setting | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `capacity.tokens` | 500000 | Token-forecast ceiling for the batch; a warning only, never a gate |
| `capacity.minutes` | 240 | Wall-clock ceiling for the run; feeds the appetite breaker |
| `capacity.units` | 8 | Unit-count ceiling for the run; feeds the appetite breaker |

`sprint plan` sizes the batch against these and flags an over-budget batch **at plan time** - while the operator can still cut it, instead of mid-run when the breaker halts the sprint. Over budget never refuses to plan: a script cannot observe token spend, and the forecast is `sum(Points) x a measured tokens-per-point rate`, so the plan quotes a plausible **range** rather than a bare number that reads as fact. The wall-clock and unit axes are the real breaker. 0 on an axis = unbounded.

**Provisional, and re-measured.** The tokens-per-point rate is derived from `sdlc-studio/retros/VELOCITY.md` - actual tokens over points delivered - and re-read every sprint, so it tracks the project rather than a constant. Until enough sprints have recorded points it falls back to a seed rate, and the plan says which it used. Nothing recalibrates the capacity ceilings automatically - a human reads the velocity trend and decides.

---

## Run Appetite {#appetite}

The unattended-run circuit breaker: how much a run may spend before it stops cleanly. Its default **is** the sprint capacity above; these keys pin one axis independently of it.

| Setting | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `appetite.minutes` | 0 | 0 = inherit `capacity.minutes` |
| `appetite.units` | 0 | 0 = inherit `capacity.units` |

The appetite is resolved **once**, at plan time, most specific first: `sprint plan --appetite-minutes N --appetite-units N`, then a non-zero key above, then the sprint capacity. `sprint plan --write` stamps the resolved pair on the run state, and that is what the breaker (`loop_guard budget`) reads back - so the ceiling the plan sized the batch against is the ceiling that stops the run. The breaker is evaluated at unit boundaries and stops the run cleanly when the appetite is spent - a distinct exit code from a per-unit quarantine, with units left in their true status. Both axes are deterministic (wall-clock from the run start, units from those now terminal); tokens are a forecast only, never a gate. The appetite is never auto-extended - a fresh run resets it. See `reference-sprint.md#appetite`.

---

## Skill Source Repo {#skill-source-repo}

Where a **promoted** lesson (`lessons add --global`) is written.

| Setting | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `skill_source_repo` | unset | Path to the sdlc-studio source checkout that `add --global` writes into |

An installed or vendored skill copy is a deployment artefact: an update replaces the whole folder, so a lesson authored inside it is destroyed and nothing warns you. `lessons add --global` therefore writes only where git actually holds the file - inside a work tree, not gitignored, and with the lessons registry (`_index.md`) version-controlled - and refuses otherwise (non-zero exit, naming the reason and the remedy) instead of reporting a success it did not achieve. Work-tree membership alone is not enough: a vendored `.claude/skills/` copy is inside the consuming project's work tree and is normally gitignored.

```text
# sdlc-studio/.config.yaml
skill_source_repo: ~/code/sdlc-studio
```

With the key set, a promoted lesson lands in `<skill_source_repo>/.claude/skills/sdlc-studio/lessons/`, `git status` in that repo shows it, and committing it ships the lesson with the next skill release. Unset, promotion is refused and the project tier (`sdlc-studio/.local/lessons.md`, the default, no config needed) still works. See `reference-agentic-lessons.md#lessons-accumulation`.

---

## Contract Tables {#contract-tables}

The structured tables in PRD and TRD that **are** the feature contract. The default anchors (`§3 Feature Inventory`, `§6 Data Models`) match the v2 PRD/TRD templates.

```text
contract_tables:
  prd: "§3 Feature Inventory"
  trd: "§6 Data Models"
```

Override per-project if the project's PRD/TRD use different section anchors. Strings are matched literally against the document's section headings. Setting either to `null` disables the cross-check for that document.

The `code implement` workflow uses these anchors for the **ship-time contract sync** check: when a commit touches files that imply a feature surface change (anything matching `contract_table_paths`, derived per language) but does not touch the named anchors, the workflow warns. See `reference-code.md#ship-time-contract-sync`.

---

## Release Strategy {#release-strategy}

Determines which ship-time guidance the workflow emits.

```text
release_strategy: pr-required    # solo-dev | pr-required | staged-rollout
```

| Value | Ship guidance | When appropriate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `solo-dev` | Direct commit to `main`, or branch + `git merge --ff-only main` + `git push`. **No PR.** | Single-developer projects (operator + AI assistant). The PR ceremony is friction; reviews happen via Three Amigos consult + verify + check. |
| `pr-required` | `gh pr create` + review + merge. **Default.** | Team projects where PR review is the change gate. |
| `staged-rollout` | Tag + deploy + soak window + promote. The "live" verification depth requires a stable soak before a feature can be marked Done. | Production systems with multi-environment deploys. |

`/sdlc-studio code implement` and `/sdlc-studio epic implement` branch their final-step ship guidance on this value. See `reference-code.md#release-strategy-branch` and `reference-decisions.md#release-strategy-decision`.

---

## Deploy Contract {#deploy}

The orchestrate-only deploy last-mile. The skill **gates** before and **verifies** after a
deploy; it never holds the production trigger, never auto-rolls-back, and never deploys inside the
autonomous loop. Secrets are never read - only the command you configure is invoked, and only on an
explicit, interactive `/sdlc-studio deploy`. All keys are optional; with none set, `deploy` is a pure
gate + verification harness around a deploy you trigger yourself.

```text
deploy:
  command: ""        # (optional) project's own deploy command; invoked only after a green gate and
                     #  only on an interactive deploy - never in sprint
  smoke: ""          # post-deploy check (a verify_ac expression). Smoke green == "rolled out"
  soak_minutes: 0    # soak window before a deploy is "verified" (Done). Smoke alone is not enough
  rollback: ""       # a documented PROCEDURE; the agent never fires it - deploy SURFACES it on a fail
```

| Key | Meaning | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `deploy.command` | The project's own deploy command (any ecosystem). Invoked only after the pre-deploy gate is green, and only on an interactive `deploy` - never by sprint. Leave empty to keep the skill gate-and-verify only. | `""` |
| `deploy.smoke` | Post-deploy smoke check, a `verify_ac` expression (e.g. `http GET /health -- .status == "ok"`). Smoke green marks the deploy **rolled out**. | `""` |
| `deploy.soak_minutes` | Minutes a rolled-out deploy must soak before it is **verified** (Done). Smoke alone never means verified. | `0` |
| `deploy.rollback` | A documented rollback **procedure** (steps, or a command an operator runs by hand). The agent never executes it; `deploy` surfaces it on a failed smoke. | `""` |

See `reference-deploy.md` for the workflow and `reference-deploy-readiness.md` for the verification
patterns (cold-spawn, smoke budget, soak).

---

## Model-Tier Routing {#routing}

Difficulty-aware model-tier routing. **Advisory and opt-in** - no gate ever reads a tier, and the skill never calls a model API: model ids are opaque strings the orchestrating agent passes to its own worker-spawn mechanism, so the feature is tool-neutral across agent CLIs. With `enabled: false` (the default) the sprint plan still carries each unit's difficulty band; `tier` and `model` appear only when enabled.

```text
routing:
  enabled: false
  models: {}              # e.g. {tiny: claude-haiku-4-5, medium: claude-sonnet-5, xlarge: claude-fable-5}
  floor: {bug: small, security: medium}
  critic_tier: match      # match | above
  thresholds: {tiny: 20, small: 40, medium: 60, large: 80}
  escalation: {max_same_tier: 2}
```

| Key | Meaning | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `routing.enabled` | Emit `tier`/`model` recommendations in the sprint plan. | `false` |
| `routing.models` | Sparse map of abstract tiers (`tiny/small/medium/large/xlarge`) to the project's own model identifiers. An undeclared tier degrades **upward** to the nearest declared larger tier - never downward; above the largest declared, the largest is used. | `{}` |
| `routing.floor` | Minimum tier per unit kind: bands below are lifted. `security` applies when the churn-weighted risk band is high. | `{bug: small, security: medium}` |
| `routing.critic_tier` | The independent critic's tier relative to the author: `match` (same, code units floored at medium) or `above` (one step up). The critic is never a smaller tier than the author; independence (reviewer != author) stays the enforced floor either way. | `match` |
| `routing.thresholds` | Difficulty-score cutpoints - each value is the score at which the next band starts. | `{tiny: 20, small: 40, medium: 60, large: 80}` |
| `routing.escalation.max_same_tier` | Failed attempts at the assigned tier before escalating one declared tier (within loop_guard's unchanged total attempt cap). | `2` |

The difficulty score is deterministic (`scripts/route.py estimate`): blast-radius cognitive
complexity + churn-weighted risk (`complexity.assess`), file scope, unresolved-path novelty,
AC count and story points. A signal that does not resolve defaults its subscore to 0.5 (never
0 - unknown difficulty is never minimal) and lowers confidence; low confidence bumps the
picked tier up one step. See `reference-sprint.md#model-tier-routing` for the policy.

## Plan-Review Gate {#plan-review}

Schema v3 only (dormant under `schema_version: 2`). Before a story with spec-derived ACs is
implemented, an independent reviewer must challenge its ACs against the source spec
(`scripts/plan_review.py`, wired into `transition.py` at entry to In Progress, Review, or Done
so a direct Ready->Done close cannot skip it). The trigger is **deterministic** - no model
judgement in the fire/skip decision (TRD ADR-006) - so it cannot be skipped under effort
pressure. A skip is possible only via a recorded `> **Plan-Review-Override:**` field on the
story (auditable).

| Key | Purpose | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `plan_review.affects_files_threshold` | A story touching at least this many files trips the gate. | `5` |
| `plan_review.min_difficulty` | Routed band at/above this trips the gate (`trivial<low<medium<high<extreme`). | `medium` |
| `plan_review.spec_globs` | A story whose Affects/ACs cite a path matching one of these globs is spec-derived (a document reference, not the word "spec"). Kept in step with `review.spec_paths` so both spec-protection features draw one boundary. | `[*prd*.md, *trd*.md, *tsd*.md, *requirements*, *spec*.md, specs/*, spec/*, requirements/*]` |

The gate fires when **any** signal is true. Record the verdict with `plan_review.py record
--id US.. --verdict approve --reviewer <seat> --author <plan-author>`: it writes to the
plan-review log (so it never satisfies the delivery critique gate), must be independent
(reviewer != plan author), and **pins the reviewed ACs by fingerprint** - a later edit to the
ACs invalidates the approval, so a benign plan cannot be approved then quietly inverted. The
bare `critic.py record --phase plan-review` form also records a verdict but does not pin the
ACs (back-compatible, unprotected) - prefer `plan_review.py record`.

## Spec-Edit Guard {#spec-guard}

Schema v3 only (dormant under `schema_version: 2`). A delivery must not silently falsify the
source of truth: in the N=5 benchmark a worker edited the requirements spec to match its wrong
implementation and the change passed review because nothing distinguished a requested spec edit
from an unrequested one. `scripts/spec_guard.py check --changed <files> --story
<file>` surfaces, deterministically and **per edited file**, which changed files are
requirements/spec documents and which of them the story never references. An edited spec file
the story does not name is `untraced` - the critic charter turns that into a **blocking
finding**. An edited spec file the story *does* name is reported separately: a reference is not
proof the CHANGE was requested (a `Verify: grep` line references a spec without asking to edit
it), so the critic must still confirm those. Matching is per-file so an untraced edit to one
spec cannot ride on a mention of another.

| Key | Purpose | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `review.spec_paths` | Globs identifying requirements/spec documents whose unrequested semantic edit is a blocking finding. Matched against each changed file's full path and basename. | `[*prd*.md, *trd*.md, *tsd*.md, *spec*.md, *requirements*, */specs/*, specs/*, */spec/*, spec/*]` |

The pre-check only guarantees the edit is surfaced (TRD ADR-006); the traceability judgement -
was this edit actually requested by the ticket/story? - stays with the critic.

## Using Config in Templates

Templates can reference config values using `{{config.path.to.value}}` syntax:

```markdown
| Level | Target | Rationale |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Unit | {{config.coverage.unit}}% | Core business logic |
| Integration | {{config.coverage.integration}}% | API interactions |
```

---

## Example Project Config

```text
# sdlc-studio/.config.yaml
# Legacy Python project with relaxed targets

coverage:
  unit: 75
  integration: 70

# quality.done_requires_verified (default true): when true a story cannot transition
# to Done while its executable ACs are red/never-run (the Done-gate blocks); set false to
# downgrade the gate to advisory-warn for the whole project (per-call --force always overrides).
quality:
  done_requires_verified: true
  # epic_requires_test_spec (default true): an epic must have a test-spec (linked by its
  # Epic: field) whose AC Coverage Matrix passes `verify_ac epic-ts`. Single-story work is exempt.
  epic_requires_test_spec: true
  # depth_parity_gate (default false): the story->Done depth-parity check (an AC's declared
  # `Verification target` above `functional` must not out-run the recorded depth) is advisory
  # by default; true upgrades it to a refusal. The BUG depth tiers (Fixed needs functional+,
  # production-affecting Closed needs soak) are always enforced by `transition.py` - --force
  # overrides per call.
  depth_parity_gate: false
  # mutation_max (default 25): the mutation-check gate's cost ceiling per run
  # (scripts/mutation.py); enumerations beyond it are counted as truncated -
  # un-checked coverage, never silently clean.
  mutation_max: 25
  # require_full_sections (default false): the template-tier gate refuses a story or epic that
  # reaches In Progress/Review/Done while missing the sections the full template carries. By
  # default it judges only artefacts that declare a tier (`> **Template:**`) - an unstamped bare
  # story is structurally identical to the pre-tier stories that reach Done today, so refusing
  # it would refuse them. Set true to drop the stamp from the decision entirely and judge EVERY
  # story and epic on its sections: the same rule applied universally, and the close for a
  # project that does not want a hand-removed stamp to be worth anything. `conformance.py`'s
  # `promoted` stage follows the same setting. Remedy either way: `artifact.py promote`.
  require_full_sections: false

story_quality:
  edge_cases:
    api: 6
  sizing:
    max_points: 8     # Prefer smaller stories

tdd:
  edge_case_threshold: 3  # TDD for most stories
```

---

## Conventions (tolerant convention layer)

Declare your house conventions once under `conventions:` and every adopting
check (reconcile's status column, artifact scaffolding, and other consumers of
`lib/conventions.py`) reads them from the one place. Every key defaults to the
historical behaviour, so an unconfigured project changes nothing. A
wrong-shaped value fails loud naming the offending key - the layer never
guesses.

```text
conventions:
  # Extra index header names accepted as the status column (exact cell
  # match, case-insensitive). Without this only 'Status' pins the column,
  # and reconcile diagnoses a mis-named header instead of parsing it.
  status_column:
    - Effective Status
  # Stem suffixes marking a file as a companion doc filed under an
  # artifact's id (EP0244-...-decisions.md). Default: [consultations].
  companion_suffixes:
    - consultations
    - decisions
  # Heading vocabularies the bug-readiness audit accepts. A plain string
  # is one accepted heading (word-order-insensitive: 'Fix (proposed)'
  # equals 'Proposed Fix'); a nested list is a combo - all must be present.
  bug_ready_sections:
    repro:
      - Steps to Reproduce
      - [Symptom, Root cause]
    fix:
      - Proposed Fix
  # Scaffold templates per artifact type (repo-root-relative). `new`/`batch`
  # graft the declared body onto the deterministic provenance head; a
  # declared-but-missing path is an error, never a silent fallback.
  templates:
    bug: sdlc-studio/templates/bug.md
```

## Version File

The `.version` file tracks schema version for upgrades:

```text
# sdlc-studio/.version
schema_version: 2
upgraded_from: 1          # null for new projects
upgraded_at: 2026-01-27T10:30:00Z
skill_version: "1.3.0"
created_at: 2026-01-15T09:00:00Z
```

| Field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `schema_version` | Current template schema (1=legacy, 2=modular, 3=distributed identity + triage) |
| `upgraded_from` | Previous version (for migration tracking) |
| `upgraded_at` | When upgrade was performed |
| `skill_version` | SDLC Studio version |

### Schema v3 triage lane {#triage-vocab}

Under `schema_version: 3`, findings (bug/cr/rfc) gain an `inbox` triage lane prepended to
their status vocabulary. A freshly filed finding lands in `inbox`; a `triaged` transition then
promotes it into the workflow proper, and a *different* seat must perform it (separation of
duties). The triaged target is type-specific - a finding skips the human proposal state it never
occupied:

| Type | Files into | Triages into |
| --- | --- | --- |
| bug | `inbox` | `Open` |
| cr | `inbox` | `Approved` |
| rfc | `inbox` | `In Review` |

`transition --id <ID> --status <target> --triaged-by "Name; type; version"` gates the transition:
it requires a structured `triaged_by` (type is `human`/`persona`/`agent`) and refuses loudly
without one, and rejects a triager who is the raiser (a solo human self-triage warns instead, so a
lone operator never deadlocks). `--triage-severity` records the triager's severity alongside the
raiser's for later triage-quality metrics. All of this is dormant under `schema_version: 2`;
stories and epics are authored, not triaged, so they are unaffected.

**Noise controls** (`triage:` config block) keep a flood of agent-filed findings from burying
the few that matter:

| Key | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `triage.session_cap` | `20` | Max findings one session may file; the N+1th is refused loudly. A session is keyed by the `SDLC_TRIAGE_SESSION` environment variable (set a new value to start a fresh budget); the count lives in `.local/triage-session.json`. |
| `triage.low_consolidation` | `true` | A Low-severity finding folds into a themed consolidation CR (one per theme) rather than minting its own artefact; Medium and above always get individual artefacts. |
| `triage.sample_rate` | `0.20` | Fraction of the non-always-sampled triaged findings a human audits. |
| `triage.always_sample` | `[Critical, disagreement]` | Always audited: every Critical-severity finding, and every raiser/triager severity disagreement. |

Both the finding filer and `artifact new` enforce the noise controls, so neither creation path is
a bypass. The sampling policy and its triage-quality metrics (false-positive rate, severity
inflation) live in `triage_sampling.py`, surfaced by `status triage-metrics`.

## Pipeline Profile {#profile}

`profile` selects how much of the pipeline a project runs.

| Value | Pipeline | Use when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `full` (default) | PRD -> TRD -> TSD -> personas -> epics -> stories -> implement | Any project that benefits from the full layer set |
| `lite` | PRD -> story -> implement | A small repo where the ceremony would outweigh the source |

```text
# sdlc-studio/.config.yaml
profile: lite
```

Under `lite`, a story is created without an epic, `status`/`hint` never nag about a
missing TRD/TSD/persona/epic, and executable-AC verification and reconcile behave
identically. Promote to `full` when the project outgrows it with
`scripts/lite_profile.py promote`, which inserts one umbrella epic above the existing
stories, wires them to it, and flips the profile. An unrecognised value degrades to
`full` - the profile only ever relaxes discipline when explicitly asked.

## Project Implementation

Control behaviour of `/sdlc-studio project implement`.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `commit_strategy` | enum | `per-epic` | When to auto-commit: after each wave, each epic, or at project end |
| `review_interval` | int | `3` | Run `review --quick` after this many epics |
| `auto_reconcile` | bool | `true` | Automatically reconcile after each epic completes |
| `auto_commit` | bool | `true` | Automatically commit at strategy boundaries |

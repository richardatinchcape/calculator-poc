Workflows for the unified document review command that analyses PRD, TRD, TSD, and Persona together.

## Overview

The unified review command runs document reviews across all four specification layers (Product, Technical, Test, Persona) and checks cross-document consistency. Persona is reviewed for **drift** (have personas gone stale, do PRD references still resolve, are personas still consulted) – distinct from "Persona Consultation" (using personas to assess the other documents), which is documented at step 3a.

> **Deterministic helper (run first).** `python3 "$CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR/scripts/review_prep.py" prep --format json` gathers the mechanical inputs each leg needs: artifact staleness (changed since last review), persona definition-vs-PRD usage, and the count / AC-verification inputs. Start each leg from that JSON. The review verdict - and the CODE leg in particular - stays your judgement; it is never scripted.
>
> **Agent-instructions hygiene check.** Also run `python3 "$CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR/scripts/validate.py" instructions` - it verifies the project's `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` are well-formed (AGENTS.md canonical, CLAUDE.md a `@AGENTS.md` pointer, the operating-doctrine + `LATEST.md` pointers present, the pre-release gate and the compaction re-read rule present, and no per-ship-narrative bloat). Fold any findings into the review (or fix them in the same pass) - a stale or bloated instructions file is drift like any other.

## When to Run a Unified Review

Run `/sdlc-studio review` on a deliberate cadence – it is the periodic synthesis point that keeps PRD/TRD/TSD honest. The agent-instructions file (`AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`) and commit messages are audit trails, not indexes; the review is what answers "is this project healthy?"

**Cadence (any of, whichever comes first):**

- Every 5 minor releases.
- Per-epic completion (after the closing reconcile, before the next epic starts).
- More than 4 weeks since the last unified review.
- About to tag a release (also see `templates/workflows/release-gate.md`).

**Symptom triggers (any of these mean a review is overdue):**

- The agent-instructions file or PRD §3 detail blocks have started accumulating per-ship narrative – the changelog is leaking into the index because no review has synthesised it.
- A canvas / persona consultation surfaced multiple cross-cutting concerns that no document has digested.
- The number of versions since the most recent `RV{NNNN}-unified-review-*.md` exceeds the cadence above.

The most recent unified review is always written to `sdlc-studio/reviews/LATEST.md` (see step 4 below) so it is one read away – use it as the orientation entry-point for fresh conversations rather than re-deriving project state from `git log`.

## /sdlc-studio review - Step by Step {#review-workflow}

### 1. Parse Arguments

| Flag | Effect | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| (none) | Run all document reviews (PVD if present + PRD + TRD + TSD + Persona) | - |
| `--quick` | Use cached data, skip codebase analysis | false |
| `--focus pvd` | Run only PVD review (multi-repo products) | all |
| `--focus prd` | Run only PRD review | all |
| `--focus trd` | Run only TRD review | all |
| `--focus tsd` | Run only TSD review | all |
| `--focus persona` | Run only Persona review | all |
| `--skip-personas` | Drop Persona Review from the default chain (PRD+TRD+TSD only) | false |

If `sdlc-studio/personas/` does not exist or contains no persona files, Persona Review is skipped automatically – no flag required. The four-doc default applies whenever personas exist.

**PVD review is conditional.** The PVD leg runs **only when `sdlc-studio/product/pvd.md` exists** (a multi-repo product). A single-repo project has no PVD - the leg, and the Product Manager sign-off it carries, do not apply; the PRD is the top document and the Product Owner signs it.

**The four required legs are not conditional.** PVD may read "not applicable" when its file is absent; PRD / TRD / TSD / Persona may not. When a required leg's artefact is missing, resolve it one of exactly two ways, never by narrative downgrade to "optional": **file a finding** (the default - a missing required artefact is a review finding to triage), or record an **explicit waiver** (`decisions.py waive --leg <leg> --rationale ...`) and report the leg as **"waived (see D00xx)"**. `review_prep.py`'s `required_legs` makes each leg's presence and waiver machine-visible, and `gate.py --release` fails on an absent-and-unwaived required leg - so a prose reclassification cannot reach a tag. CODE is out of scope (no single testable artefact).

**RFC review (if `sdlc-studio/rfcs/` exists).** As part of the unified pass, scan the RFCs: flag any **Draft / In Review** RFC stalled > ~14 days with no Revision-History movement; flag **Open Decisions** unresolved > 7 days (name the owner); and for **Accepted** RFCs verify each workstream has a spawned CR that exists and links back. This catches design exploration that has gone quiet before it silently blocks the dependent CRs. Report-only – RFC acceptance is always a judgement call.

### 2. Run Document Reviews

Execute reviews in sequence, collecting findings:

#### PVD Review (only if `sdlc-studio/product/pvd.md` exists)

Skip this leg entirely for a single-repo project (no PVD). When a PVD exists:

```text
1. Load sdlc-studio/product/pvd.md (+ product/manifest.yaml)
2. For each PVD product requirement / shared feature, locate the child repo(s) that own it
3. Coverage: every PVD requirement maps to a child PRD feature (flag any with no PRD home)
4. Satisfaction: each mapped requirement is met in the child repos (verified epics / shipped)
5. Identify cross-repo drift, stale coordination prose, and inter-repo API mismatches
```

> **Product Manager sign-off (the gate):** the PVD leg ends with an explicit verdict - **"PVD
> requirements satisfied: yes / no (gaps: …)"**. The Product Manager seat owns this; it is the
> review's answer to "are the product-level requirements actually met across the repos?"

See `reference-pvd.md` for the PVD layer.

#### PRD Review

```text
1. Load sdlc-studio/prd.md
2. Scan codebase for feature implementation
3. Compare features against code
4. Calculate status percentages
5. Identify gaps and stale content
```

> **Product Owner sign-off (the gate):** the PRD leg ends with an explicit verdict - **"PRD
> requirements satisfied: yes / no (gaps: …)"**. The Product Owner seat owns this; a review is not
> complete until the PRD requirements are confirmed met (or the gaps are named and tracked).

See `reference-prd.md#prd-review-workflow` for details.

#### TRD Review

```text
1. Load sdlc-studio/trd.md
2. Analyse architecture against implementation
3. Check ADRs are current
4. Verify tech stack matches reality
5. Identify drift from documented design
```

See `reference-trd.md#trd-review-workflow` for details.

#### TSD Review

```text
1. Load sdlc-studio/tsd.md
2. Parse coverage data (.coverage, lcov.info)
3. Check framework versions against package files
4. Verify CI/CD quality gates
5. Identify coverage and strategy gaps
```

See `reference-tsd.md#tsd-review-workflow` for details.

#### Persona Review

```text
1. Load sdlc-studio/personas/index.md (and per-persona files)
2. Build the staleness map: for each persona, last consult date + last referenced-in-CR/Story date
3. Cross-check: every persona referenced in PRD §1/§2 still exists in personas/
4. Cross-check: every persona consulted on a CR/Story in the last `personas.staleness_days`
                (default 90 days) is still present (catches stale references after rename)
5. Identify drift:
   - Personas not consulted within the staleness window → "stale" (suggest refresh / archive / consult)
   - Personas referenced in PRD but missing from personas/ → "broken reference"
   - Duplicate personas (same role + name) → "duplicate"
   - Personas with no CR/Story references at all → "unused" (suggest archive or first-consult)
```

If `sdlc-studio/personas/` does not exist or contains no persona files, Persona Review is skipped (no warning – the project has no persona artefacts to review). The other three reviews run as normal. See `reference-persona.md#persona-review-workflow` for details (when personas exist).

### 3. Cross-Document Consistency Check

Only in full mode (not `--quick`):

#### PRD → TRD Coverage

```text
For each PRD feature:
  - Check TRD has architecture section addressing it
  - Flag features without technical design
```

#### TRD → TSD Coverage

```text
For each TRD component:
  - Check TSD has test strategy for it
  - Flag components without test coverage plan
```

#### PRD NFRs → TSD Quality Gates

```text
For each PRD non-functional requirement:
  - Check TSD has corresponding quality gate
  - Examples:
    - PRD "p95 < 200ms" → TSD performance gate
    - PRD "99.9% uptime" → TSD availability gate
```

#### PRD → Persona Reference Resolution

```text
For each persona referenced in PRD §1 (Personas) or §2 (Goals/Users):
  - Check persona file exists in sdlc-studio/personas/
  - Flag broken references as critical (PRD names a persona that no longer exists)
  - Flag PRD references to archived personas as important
```

#### Persona → CR / Story Activity

```text
For each persona in sdlc-studio/personas/:
  - Find most recent consult or reference in CRs and Stories
  - If older than `personas.staleness_days` (default 90 days):
    - Active personas: flag as stale, suggest refresh
    - Archived personas: no flag (expected)
  - If never referenced: flag as unused, suggest archive or first-consult
```

#### Persona Self-Consistency

```text
Within sdlc-studio/personas/:
  - Detect duplicate personas (same role + name)
  - Detect personas with broken cross-references (consultation guide names that no longer exist)
  - Detect personas missing from personas/index.md
```

#### CR Staleness Check

```text
If sdlc-studio/change-requests/ exists:

For each CR with status "Proposed":
  - Check created date against today
  - If older than 14 days: flag as stale
  - Suggest: approve, reject, or defer

For each CR with status "In Progress":
  - Check linked epic statuses from "Linked Epics" section
  - If ALL linked epics Done: suggest marking CR Complete
  - If SOME Done: report progress (e.g. "2/3 linked epics Done")
```

### 3a. Persona Consultation (default when personas exist)

If `sdlc-studio/personas/` contains persona files and `--skip-personas` was NOT passed:

1. Load persona index (`sdlc-studio/personas/index.md`)
2. For each reviewed document, identify relevant personas from the consultation guide:
   - **PRD:** Darren (scope, priorities), Cora (API shape, errors), Webapp Dev (API docs, schema), HA (health, sensors)
   - **TRD:** Claude Code (patterns, testability), Marcus Johnson (architecture), Cora (error contracts)
   - **TSD:** Priya Sharma (coverage, risk), Claude Code (test structure, runnable locally)
3. Consult each relevant persona on the review findings from their perspective:
   - Does the implementation meet their stated needs?
   - Are their frustrations addressed?
   - Are their "push back" triggers present in the findings?
4. Append persona verdicts to the consolidated report under a "Persona Consultation" section
5. Flag persona concerns as priority actions

**Default behaviour:** When `sdlc-studio/personas/` exists and contains persona files, persona consultation runs automatically. Use `--skip-personas` to opt out. Use `--with-personas` to force consultation even when no persona files exist (uses archetype defaults).

### 3b. Auto-Apply Mechanical Fixes

After detecting findings, automatically apply fixes that are purely mechanical (not judgment calls):

**Auto-applied (no confirmation needed):**

- PRD feature status updates matching verified epic completion
- PRD AC checkboxes matching verified implementation
- Dependency table status corrections (fact, not judgment)
- Index summary count recalculations
- Story/epic index status entries matching file statuses
- Epic AC checkboxes for criteria verified against the codebase
- Epic story breakdown checkboxes matching story statuses

**Reported only (requires user judgment):**

- Spec-to-code naming drift (e.g. interface names in TRD vs code)
- TSD test tree vs actual test file structure
- Content accuracy issues (stale descriptions, outdated architecture claims)
- Status transitions to Done (always a user decision)

To skip auto-fix: `--no-fix` flag.

### 4. Update Review State and Metadata

**CRITICAL:** After generating findings, update `sdlc-studio/.local/review-state.json` to track the review. This ensures the status dashboard recognises reviews have been conducted.

```text
1. Create sdlc-studio/.local/ directory if it doesn't exist
2. Load existing review-state.json (or create empty structure)
3. For each reviewed document (prd, trd, tsd, persona):
   a) Set artifacts.{doc}.last_reviewed = current ISO timestamp
   b) Set artifacts.{doc}.last_modified = file's git log timestamp
      (for persona, take max(mtime) across personas/ directory)
   c) Set artifacts.{doc}.review_findings_ref = RV{NNNN} ID
4. Add review entry to reviews.{RV_ID} with timestamp and findings summary
5. Write updated review-state.json
6. For each reviewed document that was modified (status updates, AC checkboxes, auto-fixes):
   a) Update `**Last Updated:**` date in the document header to today's date
   b) Add a changelog/revision history entry summarising the review changes
   c) Format: `| {date} | Claude | {type} review: {summary of changes} |`
7. Write updated review-state.json
8. Write `sdlc-studio/reviews/LATEST.md` -- the unified anchor for the review just generated. Render via `templates/reviews/unified-anchor.md`. Overwrites any previous LATEST.md. This is the canonical "most recent review" pointer; the agent-instructions file and fresh-conversation orientation should read this rather than searching the directory. The dated `RV{NNNN}-unified-review-*.md` file remains the historical record; LATEST.md is purely a stable filename pointing at the most recent unified anchor.
```

**review-state.json schema:** See `reference-outputs.md#review-state-json`.

## Quick Mode

When `--quick` is specified:

```text
1. Load cached status data from sdlc-studio/.local/status-cache.json
2. Skip codebase analysis
3. Skip cross-document consistency check
4. Display cached results with "(cached: {date})" subtitle
```

Quick mode is useful for:

- Fast status checks during development
- CI/CD quick gates
- When codebase hasn't changed

---

## Focus Mode

When `--focus {document}` is specified:

```text
1. Run only the specified document review
2. Skip cross-document consistency check
3. Display focused output for that document only
```

Example:

```bash
/sdlc-studio review --focus tsd
```

Output:

```text
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## TSD Review Workflow (Detailed) {#tsd-review-workflow}

### 1. Load TSD

```text
a) Read sdlc-studio/tsd.md
b) Parse coverage targets from document
c) Parse framework versions
d) Parse quality gate configuration
```

### 2. Analyse Current Testing State

```text
a) Coverage data:
   - Primary: Parse .coverage SQLite or coverage.xml (Python)
   - Primary: Parse coverage/lcov.info or coverage-summary.json (JS/TS)
   - Fallback: Use TSD documented values

b) Framework versions:
   - Python: Parse pyproject.toml, requirements.txt
   - JS/TS: Parse package.json
   - Compare to TSD documented versions

c) CI/CD quality gates:
   - Parse .github/workflows/*.yml
   - Parse .gitlab-ci.yml
   - Check for coverage thresholds, test commands
```

### 3. Identify Gaps

| Gap Type | Detection | Severity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Coverage below target | Actual < target | ❌ if >5% gap, ⚠️ otherwise |
| Missing test type | No tests for documented type | ⚠️ |
| Outdated framework | Current > documented | ⚠️ |
| Missing quality gate | PRD NFR without gate | ❌ |
| Stale TSD content | Document older than tests | ⚠️ |
| Test tree drift | Files in codebase not in TSD tree (or vice versa) | ⚠️ |

### 3a. Validate Test Organisation Tree

If the TSD contains a "Test Organisation" section with a file tree:

1. Glob `src/__tests__/**/*.test.ts` (or project-appropriate test pattern)
2. Compare actual test file tree against the TSD's documented tree
3. Report discrepancies:
   - Files in codebase but not in TSD tree → "undocumented test"
   - Files in TSD tree but not in codebase → "planned test" or "stale entry"
4. If `--no-fix` not set and significant drift found, offer to regenerate the test tree section:
   - Current files annotated with descriptions
   - Missing planned files annotated with `(EP00XX)` epic reference
   - Split into "Current Test Files" and "Planned Test Files" sections

### 4. Update TSD

If gaps found and user confirms:

```text
a) Update coverage percentages with actual values
b) Update framework versions
c) Add [GAP] markers for missing items
d) Update revision history
```

### 5. Report Strategy Currency

```text
TSD Currency:
├─ Coverage targets: Current
├─ Framework versions: 1 update available
├─ Quality gates: 1 missing
└─ Last sync: 2026-01-20 (7 days ago)
```

## Cross-Document Rules

### PRD → TRD Mapping

Each PRD feature should have:

- At least one TRD component addressing it
- Clear API contracts (if feature involves API)
- Data model documentation (if feature involves data)

### TRD → TSD Mapping

Each TRD component should have:

- Test strategy defined (unit/integration/E2E)
- Coverage targets appropriate to risk
- Automation approach documented

### PRD NFR → TSD Gate Mapping

| PRD NFR Type | Required TSD Gate |
| --- | --- |
| Response time | Performance threshold |
| Availability | Uptime monitoring |
| Security | Security scan stage |
| Scalability | Load test stage |

### PRD → Persona Mapping

Each persona named in PRD §1 (Personas) or §2 (Goals/Users) should:

- Have a corresponding file in `sdlc-studio/personas/`
- Be present in `sdlc-studio/personas/index.md`
- Have at least one consult / story / CR reference within `personas.staleness_days` (default 90)

A "broken reference" (PRD names a persona that no longer exists) is **critical**. A "stale persona" (no consult in 90+ days) is **important** unless the persona has been explicitly archived.

### Persona → Artefact Activity Mapping

For each active persona:

- Recent consult (`/sdlc-studio consult`) – counts as a touch
- Reference in a CR's "Stakeholders" or "Personas Consulted" section – counts as a touch
- Reference in a Story's `As a {persona}` line or persona-reference section – counts as a touch

Personas with zero touches across all artefacts within the staleness window are flagged as **unused** and should be archived or first-consulted.

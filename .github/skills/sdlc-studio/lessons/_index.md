# Cross-Project Lessons-Learned Registry

Generalisable engineering/process lessons that improve decisions on **any**
sdlc-studio project. Lives **in the skill** (shared across projects), distinct
from a project's own `.local/lessons.md` (transient agentic-wave failure memory)
and from per-project memory (project-specific facts).

> **Recall** relevant lessons before substantive decisions (`/sdlc-studio lessons recall`).
> **Promote** a lesson here (`/sdlc-studio lessons add --global`) only once it clearly
> generalises beyond the project that surfaced it. Keep entries tight.

## Notes

- IDs are global and zero-padded: `LL{NNNN}`. Files: `LL{NNNN}-{slug}.md`.
- A lesson = **generalisable** wisdom (what to do differently next time, anywhere). A project fact (a config path, an incident, a box name) is **memory**, not a lesson.
- This folder ships with the skill, so the seed set is release-curatable. An addition reaches the next release exactly one way: `lessons add --global` writes it into the skill **source checkout** (`skill_source_repo` in the project's `.config.yaml`), and someone commits it there. There is no other blessing path - and a write into an installed copy is refused, not silently lost, because a skill update replaces that folder wholesale.
- Format: see `_template.md`. Mechanism + recall/promote hooks: `help/lessons.md` + `reference-agentic-lessons.md`.

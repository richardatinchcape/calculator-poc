## Bug Tracking Workflows

## /sdlc-studio bug create - Step by Step {#bug-create-workflow}

1. **Check Prerequisites**
   - Create sdlc-studio/bugs/ if needed
   - Scan for existing bugs to determine next ID

2. **Gather Bug Details**
   Use AskUserQuestion to collect:
   - Title (short description)
   - Summary (detailed description of the issue)
   - Reproduction steps (numbered list)
   - Expected behaviour
   - Actual behaviour

3. **Determine Severity and Priority**
   Ask user or infer from description:
   - **Severity:** Critical, High, Medium, Low
   - **Priority:** P1, P2, P3, P4

4. **Link to Affected Areas**
   - Auto-detect affected stories/epics from description
   - Ask user to confirm or specify component

5. **Capture Environment**
   - Version, platform, browser if applicable
   - Any other relevant environment details

6. **Write Bug Report**
   - Use `templates/core/bug.md`
   - Assign ID: BG{NNNN}
   - Create slug (kebab-case, max 50 chars)
   - Write to `sdlc-studio/bugs/BG{NNNN}-{slug}.md`

7. **Update Index**
   - Create/update `sdlc-studio/bugs/_index.md`
   - Update counts by status and severity

8. **Update Linked Story (Optional)**
   - If linked to a story, add "Known Issues" section
   - Reference bug ID and summary

9. **Report**
   - Bug ID and file path
   - Linked stories/epics
   - Suggested next action

---

## /sdlc-studio bug list - Step by Step {#bug-list-workflow}

1. **Parse Filters**
   - `--status`: open, in_progress, fixed, verified, closed, wont_fix
   - `--severity`: critical, high, medium, low
   - `--priority`: P1, P2, P3, P4
   - `--epic`: EP{NNNN}
   - `--story`: US{NNNN}
   - `--assignee`: name

2. **Read Bug Files**
   - Load all from sdlc-studio/bugs/
   - Parse metadata from each file

3. **Apply Filters**
   - Match against specified criteria
   - Default: show all open bugs

4. **Sort Results**
   - By severity (Critical first)
   - Then by priority (P1 first)
   - Then by age (oldest first)

5. **Display Output**

   ```text
   ## Open Bugs (12)

   | ID | Title | Severity | Priority | Age |
   |----|-------|----------|----------|-----|
   | BG0003 | Player falls through floor | Critical | P1 | 2d |
   ```

## /sdlc-studio bug fix --bug BG{NNNN} - Step by Step {#bug-fix-workflow}

1. **Read Bug Details**
   - Load bug file
   - Extract reproduction steps, affected areas
   - Verify status is Open or In Progress

2. **Update Status**
   - Change status: Open → In Progress
   - Update "Updated" date
   - Add revision history entry

3. **Analyse Root Cause**
   Use Task tool with Explore agent:

   ```text
   For bug [BG{NNNN}]: [Title]
   Reproduction: [steps]
   Affected: [component/story]

   1. Search for relevant code files
   2. Identify likely cause of behaviour
   3. Suggest fix approach
   4. Identify tests to add
   ```

4. **Present Fix Plan**
   - Root cause analysis
   - Files to modify
   - Suggested approach
   - Tests to add

4b. **Three Amigos Consultation (Default)**
   Unless `--skip-personas` flag used, run Three Amigos review of the fix plan:

- **Sarah Chen (PO):** Assesses user impact of the bug, validates fix priority against roadmap, confirms scope of fix is appropriate (not over/under-scoped)
- **Marcus Johnson (Eng):** Reviews root cause analysis for accuracy, validates fix approach for architectural soundness, checks for potential side effects or regression risks
- **Priya Sharma (QA):** Plans regression test coverage, identifies related test scenarios that need updating, assesses risk of fix introducing new issues, validates that reproduction steps are captured

   **Apply findings:**

- Update fix plan with persona feedback
- Add regression test suggestions from QA to the plan
- Flag any architectural concerns from Eng for resolution before coding

1. **Prompt for Regression Test**
   - Suggest test case based on reproduction steps
   - Link to relevant test spec

2. **Mark Fix Complete (--complete)**
   When user runs with `--complete`:
   - Update status: In Progress → Fixed
   - Fill in "Root Cause Analysis" section
   - Fill in "Fix Description" section
   - Add files modified to table
   - Add tests added to table
   - Update linked story with fix reference
   - Update revision history

---

## /sdlc-studio bug verify --bug BG{NNNN} - Step by Step {#bug-verify-workflow}

Quick happy path: verify fix and close in one step.

1. **Check Prerequisites**
   - Verify bug status is "Fixed"
   - If not, report error and suggest `bug fix --complete`

2. **Read Bug and Fix Details**
   - Load fix description
   - Identify tests added
   - Identify reproduction steps

3. **Run Associated Tests**
   - Execute tests listed in "Tests Added" section
   - Report pass/fail status
   - If tests fail, abort and report

4. **Verification Checklist**
   Guide user through:
   - [ ] Fix verified in development
   - [ ] Regression tests pass
   - [ ] No side effects observed
   - [ ] Documentation updated (if applicable)
   - [ ] Verification depth recorded (`smoke` / `functional` / `conversational` / `soak` / `live`) – see `reference-test-best-practices.md#verification-depth-tiers`

5. **Update Bug Report**
   - Check off verification items
   - Fill in verifier and verification date
   - **Set `Verification depth:`** to the highest tier the fix has actually achieved. Smoke alone is never sufficient to mark Fixed; functional is the minimum to escalate. A production-affecting bug must reach `soak` before Closed.
   - Update status: Fixed → Closed (verified)
   - Record close reason as "Verified"
   - Add revision history entry

6. **Update Index**
   - Move from "Open Bugs" to closed section
   - Update counts

7. **Update Linked Story**
   - If bug was linked, update story's "Known Issues"
   - Mark as resolved with bug reference

8. **Report**
   - Verification status
   - Test results
   - Bug closed

---

## /sdlc-studio bug close --bug BG{NNNN} - Step by Step {#bug-close-workflow}

Close a bug with reason selection.

1. **Check Prerequisites**
   - Verify bug status is "Fixed" or "Open"
   - If already closed, report error
   - **Check verification depth.** A production-affecting bug (`> **Production-affecting:** yes`) cannot be Closed until its `Verification depth:` field reaches `soak` (default 7-day window). A non-production bug must be at least `functional` to be marked Fixed. Smoke-only verification is never sufficient. **Enforced, not advisory:** `transition.py` refuses Fixed below `functional` and a production-affecting Closed below `soak`; a missing depth field on a gated transition is refused, not assumed (`--force` records an override). See `reference-test-best-practices.md#verification-depth-tiers` and the *Hypothesis discipline* gate in `reference-operator-heuristics.md#hypothesis-discipline`.

2. **Prompt for Close Reason**
   Use AskUserQuestion:
   - **Verified** - Fix confirmed working (same as `bug verify`)
   - **Rejected** - Not a valid bug
   - **Won't Fix** - Valid bug but intentionally not addressing

3. **If Verified**
   - Run verification checklist (same as `bug verify`)
   - Only close if tests pass

4. **Update Bug Report**
   - Update status → Closed
   - Record close reason
   - Update "Updated" date
   - Add revision history entry

5. **Update Index**
   - Move from "Open Bugs" to appropriate closed section
   - Update counts

6. **Update Linked Story**
   - If bug was linked, update story's "Known Issues"
   - Mark as resolved with bug reference

7. **Report**
   - Bug closed with reason
   - Total time from report to close

**Tip:** Use `bug verify` for the common case of closing a verified fix.

## /sdlc-studio bug reopen --bug BG{NNNN} - Step by Step {#bug-reopen-workflow}

1. **Check Prerequisites**
   - Verify bug status is "Closed" or "Won't Fix"
   - If not, report error

2. **Gather Reopen Reason**
   Use AskUserQuestion:
   - Why is this being reopened?
   - Is this a regression?
   - New reproduction steps?

3. **Update Bug Report**
   - Update status: Closed → Open
   - Add "Reopen Note" to Notes section
   - Link to related test failure if applicable
   - Add revision history entry

4. **Update Index**
   - Move back to "Open Bugs" section
   - Update counts

5. **Update Linked Story**
   - Re-add to story's "Known Issues"

6. **Report**
   - Bug reopened
   - Previous fix details for reference

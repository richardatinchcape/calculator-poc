Workflows for upgrading projects between schema versions and detecting version mismatches.

## The commands called "upgrade" {#three-upgrades}

Several operations carry the word "upgrade". This table is the single place that names what each one
changes and when to reach for it - each command's help links here.

| Command | Upgrades | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/sdlc-studio migrate` | **everything, in one pass** - orchestrates the below plus the artefact-review sweep, into one report | you just want "bring this project up to date"; the front door |
| `/sdlc-studio skill-update` | the **installed skill** (the tool itself) to the latest published release | a newer release exists; the startup notice prompts it |
| `/sdlc-studio project upgrade` | a **consuming project's artefacts and conventions** to what the new skill expects (config, provenance cutoff, personas, AGENTS.md, index drift) | a long-lived project has fallen behind the skill; `skill-update` offers it after a bump |
| `/sdlc-studio upgrade` | a single project's **artifact document shape** (the v1 -> v2 schema transform) | the project is on schema v1 and you want the modular v2 layout |

Order when a project is far behind: run `skill-update` first (get the new tool), then `migrate` -
it orchestrates the rest (`upgrade` for schema-v1 doc shape, `project upgrade` for conventions +
version, `migrate_v3 sizing` for the sizing model) and reports the artefacts that need a human.

## migrate - one pass over everything {#migrate}

`migrate` is the front door for "bring this project up to date". It orchestrates the pieces
rather than making you run and read each one:

1. **project upgrade** - conventions + the version stamp.
2. **migrate_v3 sizing** - a container's legacy Effort/Points converted to a T-shirt `Size`.
3. **the artefact-review sweep** - every open artefact reviewed: an accepted childless request is
   flagged for `refine`, a childless Issue for `triage`, a delivery unit sized in legacy Effort for
   a re-size.

It emits ONE report, split into **deterministic** (what it upgraded automatically - version,
config, sizing conversions) and **needs a human** (each item with the exact command). The honesty
rule: it auto-applies only the deterministic, reversible set; it never guesses a judgement (a
breakdown, a triage, a re-size - there is no honest Effort->Points map, so a legacy Effort is
reported, never auto-converted to points). Dry-run by default; `--apply` writes the deterministic
set. See [the two-backlog migration](#two-backlog-migration) for the sizing/refine detail migrate
surfaces.

## Schema Versions

| Version | Format | Key Characteristics |
|---------|--------|---------------------|
| 1 | Legacy | Verbose templates, embedded validation, copied constraints |
| 2 | Modular | Core + modules, progressive disclosure, reference-based constraints |

---

## Two-backlog model migration {#two-backlog-migration}

A separate, **opt-in** upgrade: the two-backlog workflow (Discovery vs Delivery) and the Fibonacci
sizing model (a T-shirt `Size` on a request/container, `Points` on a delivery unit). It is a
breaking change, so it ships in a semver-major release - but the hard gates are **off by default**,
so an existing project keeps its old flow (plan a CR, complete it whole, size a CR in points) until
it turns the workflow on. Upgrade with zero disruption; adopt when ready.

Three steps:

1. **Convert the sizing.** `migrate_v3.py sizing` (dry-run report) then `migrate_v3.py sizing
   --confirm` (write). Deterministic and idempotent: a cr/rfc/epic with a legacy `Effort:` (S/M/L)
   or `Points:` gets a `Size:`. What it **cannot** convert safely it **reports, never guesses**: a
   story/bug carrying `Effort` gets no automatic `Points` (there is no honest `Effort -> Points`
   map - re-size it in points), and an accepted childless request is flagged to refine.
2. **Refine your accepted requests.** `refine show --request <id>`, then `refine apply --request
   <id> --epic-title "..." --story "title|points" ...` (or `refine add` for a later slice) wires the
   `Parent:` / `Decomposed-into:` links. A request then reaches its terminal status only by
   derivation, when its children are done.
3. **Turn it on.** Add `two_backlog:\n  enforce: true` to `sdlc-studio/.config.yaml`. Leave it off
   (or absent) to keep the old flow.

Reversible: the sizing migration only ADDS a `Size:` line (never removes `Effort`/`Points`), and the
workflow is one config line - unset `enforce` to return to the old flow.

## Version Check (hint and status only)

Version checks run on `/sdlc-studio hint` and `/sdlc-studio status` commands only. See `help/hint.md` and `help/status.md` for the pre-flight workflow.

### Dismissal File

Location: `sdlc-studio/.local/upgrade-dismissed.json`

```json
{
  "dismissed": true,
  "dismissed_at": "2026-01-27T10:30:00Z",
  "schema_version_at_dismissal": 1
}
```

Create the `.local/` directory if it doesn't exist.

---

## Version Detection

### On Any Command

```text
1. Check for sdlc-studio/.version
2. If missing → assume v1 (legacy)
3. Read schema_version from file
4. If schema_version < current skill version:
   - Display upgrade suggestion
   - Continue with command (don't block)
```

### Upgrade Suggestion Output

```text
⚠️ Project uses schema v1 (current: v2)
   Consider upgrading: /sdlc-studio upgrade --dry-run
```

---

## /sdlc-studio upgrade - Step by Step {#upgrade-workflow}

### 1. Parse Arguments

| Flag | Effect |
| ------ | -------- |
| (none) | Interactive upgrade with confirmation |
| `--dry-run` | Preview changes without applying |
| `--force` | Upgrade without confirmation |

### 2. Detect Current Version

```text
a) Read sdlc-studio/.version
   - If exists: use schema_version
   - If missing: assume v1

b) Compare to skill's current schema version
   - If already current: "Project is already at latest version"
   - If newer: "Project was created with newer skill version"
```

### 3. Inventory Existing Artifacts

```text
Scan sdlc-studio/ for all artifacts:
- prd.md, trd.md, tsd.md, personas.md
- epics/EP*.md
- stories/US*.md
- plans/PL*.md
- bugs/BG*.md
- test-specs/TS*.md
- reviews/RV*.md

Record for each:
- ID (from filename or frontmatter)
- Filename
- Content hash (for change detection)
```

### 4. Transform Each Artifact

For each artifact type, apply version-specific transformations:

#### PRD (v1 → v2)

| Estimation Summary | Remove from story index |

### 5. Preserve During Transform

**Always preserved:**

- Artifact ID (EP0001, US0001, etc.)
- Title
- Status
- Relationships (Epic → Story, Story → Plan)
- User-written content (descriptions, AC, notes)
- Revision History

**Never lose data:**

- Content from removed sections goes to archive if valuable
- Links are updated to new locations
- No orphaned references

### 6. Update Index Files

```text
a) Regenerate each index in new format
b) Preserve all artifact references
c) Remove deprecated sections (By Status, etc.)
d) Update file paths if templates moved
```

### 7. Write Version File

Create or update `sdlc-studio/.version`:

```yaml
schema_version: 2
upgraded_from: 1
upgraded_at: 2026-01-27T10:30:00Z
skill_version: "1.3.0"
created_at: <preserved or now>
```

## /sdlc-studio project upgrade - convention migration {#project-upgrade-workflow}

`skill-update` updates the **skill** (the tool); `project upgrade` migrates a **consuming project's
artefacts** to what the new skill expects. It is broader than the schema transform above:
it also covers the convention drift a long-lived project accumulates (no `.config.yaml`, old
personas, missing provenance, stale AGENTS.md, missing `Verify:` lines). The schema `upgrade` (the
v1 -> v2 doc-shape transform) is one part; if the project is schema v1, run `/sdlc-studio upgrade`
first, then `project upgrade` for the conventions.

Backed by `scripts/project_upgrade.py`. **Dry-run by default; `--apply` performs only the safe
deterministic set; nothing destructive; idempotent.**

### Re-baseline: in-flight artefacts vs the capability delta {#rebaseline}

Schema v3 only. Upgrading the project does not by itself update the **non-terminal artefacts** an
upgrade leaves behind - stories and CRs planned under the old doctrine (no routing/difficulty
stamp, no plan-review verdict for a gate that landed after they were planned, ACs written before
the Verify-line convention). `project upgrade` censuses every non-terminal artefact and buckets
each gap: **backfill** (a deterministic stamp computable now, applied on `--apply` - e.g. a
`Difficulty` band from `route estimate`), **re-review** (matches a gate's deterministic trigger
but lacks the verdict - reported, never auto-run), and **residual** (judgement gaps the tooling can
only name). Terminal artefacts are never touched.

**A new gate attaches enforcement at the artefact's next transition, never retroactively** - a
completed transition is never invalidated (the schema-v3 era-gating precedent). So an in-flight
story that pre-dates a gate is flagged for re-review and gates only when it next moves; its past
transitions stand. No fabricated history: telemetry and metrics begin at the upgrade, and no
back-dated rows are invented for events that happened before it.

1. **Detect** the gap: `project_upgrade.py --root <project>` reads `sdlc-studio/.version` (schema +
   skill) vs the installed skill. "Already current" -> stop.
2. **Dry-run plan** (default): the migration report, split into
   - **Auto-correctable** (applied on `--apply`): scaffold `sdlc-studio/.config.yaml` (with
     `provenance.adopt_after` = the highest existing id, so existing artefacts are exempt - not
     mass-stamped), scaffold or bump `sdlc-studio/.version`, install the **v3.1 default amigo
     cards** (see below), and `reconcile` index/status drift.
   - **Needs judgement** (reported, **never auto-applied, never filed as CRs**): old personas, with
     the finding naming the actual signal - structural-layout drift (move `team/`/`stakeholders/`
     dirs, reword `index.md`) vs content-model drift (rewrite to `persona-template.md` / a review
     seat); any seat/amigo role overlap heads-up;
     AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md refresh from `templates/agent-instructions.md` **preserving project
     sections**; missing `Verify:` lines and informal AC; an optional `constitution.md`.
   - **Changed since your version** (the capability delta): a compact digest
     of the shipped CHANGELOG entries between the project's recorded
     `skill_version` (exclusive) and the installed version (inclusive),
     grouped Added-first and capped per group with a "+N more" tail. New
     **advisory-when-absent gate lanes** in the gap are named individually
     with their baseline pointer (e.g. the mutation lane reports not-run
     until you run `scripts/mutation.py`) - a new integrity check must be a
     directed next step, not an accidental discovery. Degrades honestly: no
     shipped CHANGELOG or an unparseable range prints an explicit
     "capability delta unavailable" line, never silence.
3. **Confirm, then `--apply`** the auto-correctable set.
4. **Ask the operator the numbering question (v2 projects only).** Schema v3 replaces
   sequential ids (`US0001`) with collision-free ULID ids (`US-01JQK3F8`) so several
   people - and agents - on different machines with different git states can file work
   concurrently without minting clashing ids: the multi-team feature of v4. It is the
   operator's decision, asked explicitly and never auto-applied, with **three answers,
   all fully supported**:
   - **Full migration** - every artefact renumbered, links rewritten, old ids kept as
     aliases: `migrate_v3.py plan` (preview), then `migrate_v3.py apply --confirm`.
   - **Forward-only** - existing artefacts keep their sequential ids (they may be
     referenced outside the system - tickets, chat, docs - and stay valid there); only
     new artefacts mint ULIDs: `migrate_v3.py adopt --confirm`. The two id eras coexist
     by design.
   - **Decline** - stay on v2 sequential numbering; every other upgrade step still lands.
   Both `apply` and `adopt` refuse without `--confirm` - the switch is never headless.
5. **Work the report** by hand for the judgement items (the agent-assisted steps - rewrite
   personas, refresh AGENTS, backfill Verify), guided by this file.
6. **Run the gate** (`scripts/gate.py`) - the residual is the judgement work still to do.

### v3.1 default amigo cards (seat-aware, greenfield-only)

v3.1 ships the enriched **amigo defaults** - the Engineering, QA, and Product amigos
(`templates/personas/amigos/`): a personal engineering team that both builds and reviews. The
upgrade is **seat-aware**: a project that already has review seats (`personas/seats/`) filling a
role keeps them - the default for a covered role is **enrich in place**, never a parallel generic
card beside the authored seat. The match is on each seat card's **declared role field** (the
machine-readable `<!-- role: engineering -->` comment), never the filename, since seats are named
after people.

- **Greenfield only:** `--apply` installs a generic amigo card into `sdlc-studio/personas/amigos/`
  **only when no seat or amigo already fills that role**. A role covered by a seat is not reported
  as a missing amigo and no parallel card is written.
- **Idempotent, never overwrites:** a card already present - a default the project kept or one it
  customised - is left untouched; only the absent, uncovered roles are written. The upgrade output
  names each card it added.
- **Overlap heads-up (no silent collision):** when a review seat and an amigo card both claim the
  same role, the upgrade emits an **explicit heads-up naming the overlap** - in `--dry-run` too -
  so the operator is never left to notice two parallel role systems unaided. The model is one
  role-based actor system on the `seats/` home; converge the overlap onto it.

The persona finding from `project upgrade` also names the **actual structural signal** that fired
(a nested `team/` or `stakeholders/` dir, the word "amigo" in `index.md`, or an old-model heading in
a named file), separating structural-layout drift (move dirs / reword index) from content-model
drift (rewrite to the Cooper model), so the operator fixes the right thing first - a content rewrite
alone does not clear a layout signal.

## Backward Compatibility

### v2 Skill Reading v1 Artifacts

The v2 skill can read v1 artifacts without upgrade:

1. Detect missing `.version` file → assume v1
2. Apply v1 parsing rules
3. Ignore v2-only sections if missing
4. Suggest upgrade on first command

### Upgrade Is Optional

- Upgrade is recommended but not required
- All v1 functionality continues to work
- New v2 features require upgrade
- No functionality loss, only verbosity reduction

---

## Configuration Upgrade

When upgrading, also check for new config options:

1. Load existing `sdlc-studio/.config.yaml` if present
2. Compare against current `config-defaults.yaml`
3. Report new options available
4. Do not auto-add (user must opt-in)

---

## Rollback

No automatic rollback is provided. To revert:

1. Use git to revert changed files
2. Delete `.version` file to return to v1 detection
3. Old templates continue to work

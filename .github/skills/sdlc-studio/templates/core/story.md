<!-- Affects: the source files this story changes. Declaring it lets the engagement floor
     confirm a single-file change is genuinely small; a multi-file change without an acceptance
     criterion is refused. See reference-config.md#engagement-floor. -->

<!-- Plan-Review (schema v3, optional): the plan-review gate's verdict for a spec-derived
     story, as `verdict · reviewer · date` - recorded via `plan_review record` (which pins the
     ACs by fingerprint). Leave blank when the gate does not apply. A `> **Plan-Review-Override:**`
     field here is the only sanctioned skip of the gate (auditable). See reference-config.md#plan-review. -->

## Inherited Constraints

> See Epic for full constraint chain. Key constraints for this story:

| Source | Type | Constraint | AC Implication |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Epic | {{epic_constraint_type}} | {{epic_constraint}} | {{constraint_ac}} |
| PRD | Performance | {{performance_constraint}} | {{performance_ac}} |
| PRD | Security | {{security_constraint}} | {{security_ac}} |

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: {{ac1_name}}

- **Given** {{ac1_given}}
- **When** {{ac1_when}}
- **Then** {{ac1_then}}
- **Verify:** {{ac1_verify}}
- **Verification target:** {{ac1_verification_target}}
- **Mutation-checked:** {{ac1_mutation_checked}}
- **Verified:** no

### AC2: {{ac2_name}}

- **Given** {{ac2_given}}
- **When** {{ac2_when}}
- **Then** {{ac2_then}}
- **Verify:** {{ac2_verify}}
- **Verification target:** {{ac2_verification_target}}
- **Mutation-checked:** {{ac2_mutation_checked}}
- **Verified:** no

### AC3: {{ac3_name}}

- **Given** {{ac3_given}}
- **When** {{ac3_when}}
- **Then** {{ac3_then}}
- **Verify:** {{ac3_verify}}
- **Verification target:** {{ac3_verification_target}}
- **Mutation-checked:** {{ac3_mutation_checked}}
- **Verified:** no

> **Verification target tiers:** `functional` (single round-trip – default) | `conversational` (multi-turn / multi-step session continuity) | `soak` (live traffic over a window) | `live` (operator-confirmed in production). End-to-end ACs default to `conversational`; production-affecting ACs default to `soak`; ACs shipping behind a flag awaiting promotion default to `live`. See `reference-test-best-practices.md#verification-depth-tiers`.
>
> **Mutation-checked** answers a prior question the tiers assume: *would the test go red if the feature were broken?* For any behaviour-bearing AC (`functional` and above), break the feature on purpose (unset the field the loader delivers, revert the component to a stub, invert the guard), confirm the AC's test **fails**, then restore. Record the result, e.g. `unsetting reAttestation turns governance-lifecycle GP1 red`. Leave `n/a` only for pure config/layout ACs with no runtime behaviour. A test never seen to fail cannot gate a release - see `reference-test-best-practices.md#assertion-integrity`.

## Estimation

**Points:** {{1|2|3|5|8|13|20}}
**Complexity:** {{complexity}}

> **Points** are a RELATIVE size on the modified Fibonacci scale (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20) - not
> "how long will this take" but "is this bigger than that one", sized against stories already
> delivered. The gaps widen deliberately, because uncertainty grows with size: it is much harder
> to argue a story is a 7 rather than an 8 than to choose between a 5 and an 8. A value off the
> scale is REFUSED, never rounded - the scale IS the estimate. Above 8, SPLIT the story;
> estimator consistency collapses beyond it, so a bigger number is a triage failure rather than
> a harder estimate. This is the one size vocabulary: the planner, the forecast and the measured
> velocity all read this field.

## Rollback Envelope

If `affects_production_runtime: false`, replace with: *Not applicable – story does not change runtime behaviour.*

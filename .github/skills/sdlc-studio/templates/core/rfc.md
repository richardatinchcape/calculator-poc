Related: help/rfc.md, reference-rfc.md
Use an RFC (not a CR) when the design space is UNSETTLED – multiple viable options,
open decisions, or cross-cutting/cross-repo impact that must be agreed before any
change is committed. An accepted RFC SPAWNS CRs (its workstreams); it does not
itself get actioned into epics.

## Recommendation

{{leaning_with_rationale_or_"TBD – pending the Open Decisions below"}}

## Open Decisions

> The unsettled cores – the reason this is an RFC. Each must resolve before the
> dependent workstream can be built. List owner + how it gets resolved (consult,
> spike, operator call, threat model).

| # | Decision | Options | Owner | How it resolves | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| D1 | {{decision}} | {{options}} | {{owner}} | {{consult / spike / operator}} | Open |

## Risks

## Phased Plan / Workstreams

> How this decomposes into CRs once accepted. Each workstream becomes one (or a
> few) CRs that reference back to this RFC. Sequence + dependencies here.

| WS | Workstream | Repo | Becomes | Depends on |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WS1 | {{workstream}} | {{repo}} | CR (TBD) | – |

## Decision

> *Filled on acceptance.* Chosen option + rationale + the CRs spawned.

**Outcome:** {{accepted_option | superseded | withdrawn}}
**Rationale:** {{why}}
**Spawned CRs:** {{cr_links}}

> **Cross-repo note:** if this RFC spans repos (e.g. backend-api + web-client),
> the spawned CRs are filed in BOTH and cross-referenced. Numbers are per-repo –
> confirm the next free number against `origin/main` before filing (see
> reference-cr.md cross-repo guard).

## Notes

- An RFC explores an **unsettled** design space (multiple options, open decisions) BEFORE a CR commits a change. Use a CR directly when the change is already clear.
- Lifecycle: **Draft → In Review → Accepted** (then spawns CRs). Terminal: **Superseded / Withdrawn**.
- An **Accepted** RFC is not "done" – it stays the living design home its CRs reference.
- RFCs are numbered globally (RFC-0001, RFC-0002, …). Cross-repo: confirm the next free number against `origin/main` before filing.
- Promote with `/sdlc-studio rfc accept --rfc RFC-NNNN` (records the decision + spawns/links the workstream CRs).

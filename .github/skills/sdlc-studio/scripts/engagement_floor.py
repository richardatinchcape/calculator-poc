"""SDLC Studio engagement floor: a deterministic planning floor for multi-file work.

The 2026-07 benchmark rerun showed weaker models judging a multi-file, spec-interacting
change "too small for ceremony" and shipping the hidden-requirement defect the planning pass
catches, while stronger models engaged unprompted. Leaving the threshold to the model's own
judgement rebuilds that failure. This floor is NOT a judgement: it is a file count and a
presence check, with no model call anywhere in the fire/skip decision.

Rule: a shipped unit (a story Done, a bug Fixed/Verified/Closed, a CR Complete) may skip the
planning pass ONLY by showing it is below the floor. It shows this one of two ways - it carries a
planning artefact (an acceptance criterion, a `Verify:` expression, or a linked plan PL), or it
DECLARES what it touched in an `Affects` field that lists a single source file. A unit that does
neither fails as `undeclared`: the blank ticket and the terse commit the weak model produces
cannot buy a silent pass. A unit whose declared/touched source count is more than one and that
carries no planning artefact fails as `unplanned`.

The exact guarantee (D0026 - do not overstate it):
  * PURE OMISSION is caught deterministically. A shipped unit that neither planned nor declares a
    real single-file footprint fails as `undeclared`. A declaration must be a CHECKABLE file path
    (`src/x.py`), not prose - `n/a`, `various`, `see the commits` can be held to nothing, so they
    are omission-equivalent and do not count.
  * UNDERSTATEMENT IN A SOLO-ID COMMIT is caught. Where a unit declares one file but its commit
    (naming only that unit) touched more, the git cross-check raises the count and the floor fires.
  * UNDERSTATEMENT IN A SHARED COMMIT was a disclosed limit, now closable with a commit-id
    convention. When a unit shares its commit with another judged id, git cannot attribute a file
    to one id among several, so a bare co-named subject is still skipped. But a `Refs: <id>` trailer
    in the commit body is an explicit statement of which id owns the change: the git leg reads it
    and attributes that commit's files to each id a trailer names, even in a shared commit. So the
    understatement IS caught once the owning unit carries a `Refs:` trailer. Absent the trailer the
    shared commit is still skipped (the pre-convention behaviour, unchanged); the `check-commit-msg`
    hook nudges an author to add one.

The two file-count signals are the declared `Affects` field and the git cross-check, and they
share a blind spot (git sees a unit only when its commit solely names its id), so requiring the
declaration is what closes PURE omission: with no way to skip planning except by declaring, an
omitted or prose-only `Affects` is itself the failure. This still catches the benchmark's observed
failure - a weak model shipping a multi-file change with NO planning.

Escape valves, each auditable, none a silent judgement:
  * `engagement_floor.adopt_after` (`.config.yaml`) exempts ids at or below a cutoff - the
    `conformance.adopt_after` precedent - so turning the floor on does not redden the backlog of
    units closed before it existed. A cutoff ABOVE the highest existing id is not grandfathering
    but a silent forward disarm, and is refused (use judgement mode to opt out visibly). Exempt
    units that WOULD violate stay counted in the report, so a cutoff cannot hide them.
  * `engagement_floor: judgement` (`.config.yaml`) is the project-global opt-out the doctrine and
    agent-instructions already document: the floor still reports, but its gate lane is advisory.
  * a recorded waiver (`decisions.py waive`) - `rule:engagement-floor` waives the whole floor for
    a project whose operator accepts the risk; `rule:engagement-floor:<id>` waives one unit. A
    waiver is a decisions-log row with a rationale, greppable and machine-detectable, not a silent
    config boolean.

The git leg does not attribute a BATCH commit (one whose SUBJECT names several ids) to any of them
UNLESS a `Refs: <id>` trailer names the id: it otherwise cannot know which file belongs to which id,
so a bare batch commit feeds no id's count (the declared `Affects` carries a genuinely multi-file
unit instead). The batch test looks at the subject line only, so a body `Refs:` trailer can only ADD
attribution to the ids it names, never remove the solo cross-check from a commit whose subject names
one id - the explicit per-id ownership statement lifts the skip, it never imposes one.

Read-only; pure stdlib core (git is a soft dependency: absent, the floor rests on the declared
`Affects` signal alone).

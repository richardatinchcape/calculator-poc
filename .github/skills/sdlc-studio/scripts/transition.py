"""SDLC Studio status transition.

`transition --id <ID> --status <new>` performs the one mechanical write-side cascade
that was still hand-driven: set an artifact's `Status` field, sync its index row and the
summary counts, and (for a story) tick/untick its checkbox in the parent epic's Story
Breakdown. Deterministic once the new status is chosen - it reuses the validated
`reconcile.apply_type` to bring the index into line with the file, so there is no
bespoke index-row editing.

Subcommand:
  set  Transition one artifact to a new status and cascade the index/epic updates.

"""SDLC Studio sprint - batch selection and ordering.

`sprint plan` selects a batch of work by query (open bugs, proposed CRs, ready
stories) and orders it, so the operator sees the triage plan before the run starts.
Ordering is by priority/severity (Critical first); dependency-topological; and WSJF
(`--order wsjf`): **Cost of Delay divided by Points**, both on the modified Fibonacci scale.
CoD falls out of the declared Priority, so WSJF runs on any groomed backlog - it needs NO seat
scores, which is why it can now actually run. When the review seats HAVE scored a unit, their
value + time-criticality + risk-reduction replaces the derived CoD; the denominator is always
the unit's `Points`, because there is only one size vocabulary.

Under WSJF, priority is deliberately NOT the dominant axis: a job worth less but four times
cheaper does go first, and that is the whole economic content of WSJF. `--order priority` is
there for anyone who wants strict priority bands instead.

THE GATE REFUSES A UNIT ABOVE 8 POINTS (`sprint.points_split_above` to move the ceiling). Above
it the estimate is not worth having, and the answer is to DECOMPOSE - a triage decision, not an
estimation one. See the forecast block below for the measurement that demands it.

The forecast is sum(points) x a tokens-per-point rate MEASURED from this project's own evidence.
It carries the BATCH HISTORY (what sprints actually cost) beside it, and it names the evidence
the rate came from, so nobody has to take the number on trust.

The plan then SIZES the batch against the sprint's CAPACITY (`capacity.*`: tokens, wall-clock
minutes, units) and says whether it fits - at plan time, while the operator can still cut it,
rather than mid-run when the breaker halts the sprint. The same capacity resolves the run
APPETITE that `loop_guard budget` later breaks on, so the plan-time ceiling and the run-time
ceiling are ONE number and cannot disagree. Over budget is a WARNING, never a refusal: a script
cannot observe token spend, and the token model is a hypothesis, not a measurement.

The plan also EMITS the still-valid lessons digest (`lessons.plan_digest`): the lessons the
last sprints paid for arrive inside the plan the agent reads at sprint start, rather than as a
prose instruction to open a file that an agent under effort pressure skips. Read-only;
pure stdlib (lessons, telemetry and route are sibling helpers).

# costs to NOT do this yet.

# The old WSJF needed the review seats to have scored value, time-criticality and risk-reduction
# into `.local/wsjf-inputs.json` first. They almost never had, so WSJF almost never ran - and a

# worth about 1.6x the one below - the golden ratio the scale is built on - so a unit has to be

# not an accident of the mapping: a 3-point High DOES outrank an 8-point Critical, because you
# can finish it and still start the Critical sooner than the Critical would have finished. An

# A POINT IS A STABLE UNIT OF COST FROM 2 TO 8, and it BREAKS ABOVE THAT. Measured tokens per

# are systematically OVER-estimated - 1.9x cheaper per point than every band below - and all
# three estimators returned them with LOW confidence and the words "should be split", unprompted.
# That is why the gate refuses above 8 (`points_split_above`): the ceiling is not a ceremony, it
# is the boundary of the region where the model is known to work.
#
# NO BASE TERM, DELIBERATELY. A least-squares fit adds one (8,043) and does WORSE: 11/19 units

    failed - the one the forecast used to run on scored +0.03. A point is a stable unit of cost
    across the whole legal range, because the gate refuses the range where it stops being one.

    A unit with no points is NOT priced at some stand-in - it is named in `unpriced` and left out

# authority this gate exists to abolish. A unit with no `Points` cannot be forecast at all,
# and a unit that names no files cannot be checked against its neighbours - the planner
# cannot see that two of them touch the SAME FILE, so it reports them as safely parallel
# when they will collide. Both gaps were closed by hand before every plan.
#
# The gate also refuses a unit sized ABOVE the split ceiling. That one is not about grooming
# but about triage: the unit IS sized, honestly, and the honest size says nobody could size
# it. See `points_split_above`.
#
# Enforcement lives HERE, in the command people actually invoke. A separate grooming step
# that nobody runs is doctrine, and doctrine is what gets skipped under effort pressure: the
# grooming rung that already exists, and is specified to produce a reviewable estimated
# backlog, has never once been run. So `plan` refuses instead of warning: an advisory lane is
# the one that gets scrolled past.
#

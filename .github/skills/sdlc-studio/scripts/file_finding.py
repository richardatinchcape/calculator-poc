# a checklist a human reads. Writing a command-shaped `Verify: <cmd>` into that prose mints a
# check that LOOKS executable and is run by nothing, so a wrong command is a permanent false red
# and a vacuous one (a grep that matches unrelated prose) is a false green on an unbuilt feature.
# The creators refuse to write one; the validator warns about the ones already on disk.
#
# MATCHED (refused): a `Verify:` / `**Verify:**` lead-in whose tail, once its wrapping backticks,
# quotes and bold markers are stripped, is command-shaped - it opens with a shell/tool verb
# (`rg -q x`, `test -f x`, `python3 -m unittest`, `./install.sh`), or it carries a shell operator
# (`&&`, `||`, `$(...)`, a pipe into a command).
#
# LET THROUGH (honest prose): the word verify anywhere in a criterion ("Verify the operator sees
# the banner", "the verifier reports it"), and a `Verify:` lead-in followed by an outcome rather
# than a command ("Verify: the operator sees a red banner naming the file"). The target is the

# --- The grooming demand (the filer asks the PLANNER, it does not re-state the rule) ---------
#
# `sprint plan` REFUSES a batch holding an UNGROOMED unit - one that names neither the files it
# will touch (`Affects`) nor a size. A creator that cannot even RECORD `Affects` mints exactly
# that unit every time, and the repair then lands on an operator at plan time: the wrong person,
# at the wrong moment. The author knows which files are involved WHEN THEY FILE. Nobody knows it
# better later.
#
# So the creator asks the planner - not a second copy of the predicate, the predicate itself.
# The body about to be written is handed to `sprint.breakdown`, and whatever IT calls ungroomed
# is what the creator refuses. Two consequences a restated rule would have missed: a value the
# planner's parser cannot read as a file (`--affects everything`) is refused here too, and a
# future third grooming field lands in both ends at once.
#
# The escape is the planner's own, read from the same config key: `sprint.breakdown: judgement`
# makes the gate report instead of block, and an operator who has opted out is not then blocked
# at the creator either. Omission is not an escape - with no config, the fields are demanded.
#
# Scope: bug and CR - the finding types a sprint batch is built from. An RFC is not a unit of
# sprint work at all (the planner never selects one), and its whole purpose is to settle a design
# whose files are the OUTPUT of the decision, not an input to it: demanding `Affects` of an RFC
# would be grooming theatre, a field nothing downstream reads. A story is gated by the same
# planner, but it is created by decomposition rather than filed as a finding, and its grooming
# is out of this fix's scope - `--affects` is accepted on it and written when supplied.

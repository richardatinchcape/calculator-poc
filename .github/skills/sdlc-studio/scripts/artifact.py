"""Deterministic artifact create + close cascade.

`new` creates ANY numbered/indexed artifact (epic, story, plan, bug, cr, rfc, test-spec,
workflow) as a structured scaffold AND wires it: allocate a collision-free id, render a
valid file (required sections so it passes validate), append the index data-table row
(built generically from that index's own header), recompute counts, and wire cross-links
(a story into its parent epic's Story Breakdown). `close` terminal-transitions an artifact
and cascades (reusing transition). The agent fills the scaffold's content; the wiring is
deterministic. This replaces the ~10-step hand cascade (the v2.x friction).

"""The handoff guide - the remaining-work artefact an agentic run owes a human at its close.

A run that stops (goal reached, budget spent, or blocked) leaves its tail scattered across
hints, the decisions log and the retro, so the person who picks it up has no single "here
is where you start" document. `generate` writes one, and it is a JOIN over evidence that
already exists rather than new instrumentation:

  quarantined units + failure signatures  <- .local/loop-state.json  (loop_guard)
  failing / unproven ACs                  <- .local/verify-report.json (verify_ac)
  per-unit readiness issues               <- audit.audit_unit
  the lifecycle stage a unit stalled at   <- conformance.detect_conformance
  the approved batch and the run's shape  <- .local/run-state.json, .local/sprint-plan.json
  difficulty band (the suitability seed)  <- route.estimate

Two properties are load-bearing:

* **Nothing is omitted.** Every unit that is not terminal is named, with at least one
  pointer (an AC, a check, a blocker, or - always available - its own file). A batch id
  with no file on disk is reported as remaining-and-missing, never dropped; a unit the loop
  quarantined is reported even if it was never in the approved batch. A handoff that
  silently loses an item is worse than no handoff.
* **The tail is machine-readable.** `generate` emits a worklist file, so the next
  `sprint plan --worklist <file>` reads the remaining work back as a batch. No fourth batch
  source; the documented one is reused.

The suitability tag (copilot-tail vs judgement) is seeded deterministically from the
difficulty band, the quarantine reason, the stage the unit stalled at, and the tranche
audit's issues (see the JUDGEMENT_* constants). It is a seed, not a verdict: the closing
model refines it, and every tag carries the reasons it was derived from, so it can be
argued with rather than merely believed.

Subcommands:
  generate   Build the handoff, create it via the artifact machinery, emit the worklist.
  show       Print the join (JSON) without creating anything.

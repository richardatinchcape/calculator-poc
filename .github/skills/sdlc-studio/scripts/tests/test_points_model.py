"""The POINTS cost model, pinned to the evidence that established it.

This replaces the pinning tests of the estimator that died. That one forecast a flat per-unit
base plus a per-complexity slope times the blast-radius cognitive complexity, and nobody had
ever checked whether that complexity predicts anything. It does not: across 18 units with actuals
correlated with measured cost at r = +0.03. You cannot scale zero, and two recalibrations of the
coefficient were fitting a slope through noise.

What replaced it is the first predictor this project has found that works, and it was established
BLIND (RFC0038): 21 delivered units were recovered AS FILED, their declared size stripped, and
sized in modified Fibonacci by three independent estimators with no access to the outcomes.

    Points (median of 3)      r = +0.68 pooled, +0.78 on units of 8 or below
                              POSITIVE within every one of the four sprints
    declared Effort (S/M/L)   r = +0.35   a second size vocabulary, and worse. Retired
    max_cognitive             r = +0.03   dead - and it was still ordering the batch (BG0147)

The bar was set BEFORE the numbers were seen, which is the only reason a negative result was
possible (LL0036), and points cleared all four rungs of it.

These tests pin the model and the measurement it rests on. The numbers are MEASUREMENTS, not
targets: if a later reading moves them, the model is what should move.

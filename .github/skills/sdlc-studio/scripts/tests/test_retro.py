"""The retro spine: content validation, disposition, and lesson extraction.

BG0123: the gate's retro leg globbed for a filename, so a 0-byte `RETRO9999.md` returned
`[PASS] retro: batch retro RETRO9999 present`. The one gate that made the retrospective
un-skippable was the one an agent could satisfy with `touch`.

The tests that matter here are NOT the empty-file one. A guard that only catches the total
case is not a guard (LL0015), and the total case is the one that never happens - people who
skip a ceremony under a gate produce the artefact, they do not omit it. So the load-bearing
tests are the partial dodges: a retro that looks complete but left its `{{placeholder}}` in,
left a finding undecided, or declined without giving a reason.

"""SDLC Studio triage noise controls (schema v3 only - dormant under schema_version: 2).

Two creation-time controls keep a flood of agent-filed findings from burying the few that
matter (EP0014):

- **Session cap.** One session may file at most `triage.session_cap` findings; the N+1th is
  refused loudly (never a silent drop). A session is keyed by the `SDLC_TRIAGE_SESSION`
  environment variable (default `"default"`), so an orchestrator starts a fresh budget per run
  by setting a new value; the count persists in the gitignored
  `sdlc-studio/.local/triage-session.json`.
- **Low-severity consolidation.** With `triage.low_consolidation`, a Low-severity finding folds
  into a themed consolidation CR (one per theme) rather than minting its own artefact; Medium and
  above always get individual artefacts.

Both `file_finding.py` and `artifact.py` route finding creation through here, so neither path is
a bypass. Pure stdlib bar the soft PyYAML dependency behind `config.get` (the v3 path already
needs it to have read `schema_version: 3`).

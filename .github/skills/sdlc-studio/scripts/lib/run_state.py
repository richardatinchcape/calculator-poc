"""The run-state object - a sprint/epic run's identity, in one place.

The loop is executed by the MODEL calling discrete scripts, so until now a run had no
identity at all: no id, no start time, no recorded outcome. What a run did was scattered
across seven files nothing joined (`loop-state.json`, `epic-state.json`,
`sprint-plan.json`, `telemetry.jsonl`, `verify-report.json`, `reconcile-report.json`,
`wsjf-inputs.json`), so nothing could say "this run started here, aimed at that, and
stopped for this reason". The handoff needs exactly that sentence, and so does anything
later that must bound a run's appetite.

This is the object: run-local (`sdlc-studio/.local/run-state.json`, gitignored like the
rest of `.local/`), opened when the batch is approved (`sprint plan --write`) and closed
when the run stops (`handoff generate`).

Three properties are load-bearing, and each exists because breaking it loses work:

* **The batch is CUMULATIVE.** Re-planning mid-run (a re-cut tranche, a blocker sweep
  pulling work in) must never DISCARD an approved unit: the handoff joins over this batch,
  so a unit dropped from a narrowed re-cut - and never attempted, so absent from the loop
  state too - would land in no bucket at all and vanish from the handover. `open_run` on an
  open run takes the UNION, in first-approval order. Only a CLOSED run resets it.
* **Every mutation is LOCKED.** `update` is a read-modify-write; unlocked, concurrent
  writers silently lose each other's keys. The lock is taken here rather than left to each
  caller, because the callers that will hurt (a spend counter incremented per unit) have a
  wider window than any caller in this module does.
* **A corrupt file FAILS LOUD.** `read` raises rather than degrading a truncated file to
  "no run was ever opened" - which would let a close overwrite a real run's identity with a
  blank record, and print in the handover that the run was never opened. A silently dropped
  field is a lie the next reader inherits.

Extensible by contract: `update()` MERGES, and nothing here drops a key it does not
recognise. A later capability adds its own fields (an appetite ceiling, a spend counter)
without touching this module, and a close preserves them.

A library, not a command: the writers are `sprint.py` and `handoff.py`.

"""SDLC Studio schema v2 -> v3 migration.

Rewrites a workspace's sequential ids (`BG0001`) to type-prefixed short ULIDs
(`BG-01JQK3F8`), preserving creation order (the ULID timestamp is derived from
each file's date, so a directory listing keeps sorting as before). The old id is
retained as an alias in the artefact's metadata (`> **Aliases:** BG0001`) and
every intra-workspace link is rewritten to the new id, so nothing dangles.

Deterministic, dry-run-first, and idempotent: an already-migrated file (its id is
already a ULID) is skipped, so a second run is a no-op. The id map is journalled to
`sdlc-studio/.local/migrate-map.json` before the first write; an interrupted apply
resumes from that SAVED map (never a fresh plan, which would cross-wire identities),
and the journal comes off only when the migration is durable.

    migrate_v3.py plan            # preview the id map, write nothing
    migrate_v3.py apply           # perform the migration
    migrate_v3.py apply --root .  # explicit root

A completed `apply` stamps `schema_version: 3` into the workspace config itself,
so new artefacts mint ULIDs from the very next filing - the era flip is never a
manual step a walk can forget.

"""The deterministic retro spine: parse a retro, extract its lessons, and prove every
finding was dispositioned.

The retro was the only enforced ceremony with no script behind it. `gate.py` therefore
had nothing to interrogate but the filesystem - a glob for the filename - so an
empty file with the right name passed it. A gate is only as good as the thing it
can interrogate; this is that thing.

Everything here is mechanical, because everything here CAN be. Parsing a `## Lessons`
heading is parsing. Checking each finding is filed or declined is a set difference.
Judgement is reserved for what a lesson MEANS, never for whether the plumbing ran.

Subcommands:

  validate  content check - required sections, at least one real lesson, and every
            finding dispositioned. This is what the gate calls instead of a glob.
  extract   lift the `## Lessons` bullets into the project lessons log (`lessons add`),
            so a lesson written in a retro reaches the store that the next sprint reads.
  dispose   report every finding and its disposition; non-zero while any is undecided.
            The read-only half of `validate`, for a human deciding what to file.
  accuracy  estimate vs actual for the units in the retro's `Batch`: the plan's forecast
            against what telemetry measured, per unit and per batch, IN POINTS and in tokens.
            Flags any unit delivered above the split threshold. `--write` records it in the
            retro and appends the sprint's row to the velocity history.
  velocity  print the accumulated velocity history - POINTS DELIVERED PER SPRINT, and the
            tokens-per-point rate derived from it - so the next plan can see how the estimator
            has actually performed rather than trusting a constant.

The disposition rule. A finding is dispositioned when it is either filed as
an artefact (`CR0123` / `BG0045`) or DECLINED WITH A REASON. Declining is a first-class
answer and is equally green, so honesty costs exactly what noise costs and there is
nothing to game. What does not pass is silence: a finding written down and left to rot.

The measurement rule (the same rule, applied to numbers). A unit with no PER-UNIT telemetry
record has its per-unit ratio reported UNMEASURED and excluded from every ratio - never skipped,
never counted as accurate: a silent skip would let a batch of ten units with two measurements
report as a clean forecast. Silence is not a measurement, and the report says how many of the
batch it is actually speaking for. But UNMEASURED means NOT-YET-CAPTURED, not unmeasurable: the
harness tracks the token count deterministically. An interactive sprint (no runner) records no
per-unit actual, so its sprint total is supplied with `accuracy --tokens N` to yield a real,
DESCRIPTIVE sprint tokens-per-point over the delivered points - the number the velocity loop needs.
Never call an interactive sprint's tokens unknowable.

The velocity rule. VELOCITY IS POINTS DELIVERED PER SPRINT, and the tokens-per-point rate is
DERIVED from that history - actual tokens over points delivered, recomputed on every read.
Nothing hardcodes it. A rate written down as a constant is an article of faith within two
sprints, and this project has twice had to delete one; a rate that is a quotient of two things
the history records is re-measured every sprint, by construction. A unit delivered above the
split threshold is FLAGGED with its own tokens-per-point against the rest, so the rule that
says to decompose it is answerable from evidence each sprint rather than believed.

The forecast rule (the same rule again, on the other side of the ratio). The estimate is the
one the PLANNER RECORDED when it planned the sprint. It is read back verbatim and is never
re-derived from the constants in force - there is no such path, not even as a fallback. A
number recomputed at judgement time, by the model being judged, is not a prediction: change the
constants and every past sprint is retroactively deemed to have forecast something else, so the
ratio drifts to 1.0x and the loop can never falsify its own estimator. A unit with no recorded
plan-time forecast is UNFORECAST, named, and excluded from both sides - silence on the estimate
side is not evidence either, and it is not an invitation to invent one.

And the fit is not the test. A sprint whose actuals the constants were FITTED to is labelled
IN-SAMPLE: its ratio is training error, near 1.0x by construction, and it is excluded from any
accuracy figure shown as evidence. Only a sprint forecast by the constants in force, which they
were not fitted to, tells you anything.

What this does NOT do is recalibrate. It reports the accuracy and stops. The forecast
constants are a hypothesis fitted to a handful of units; auto-fitting them to the next
handful would fit noise and dress it as evidence. A human reads the history and decides.

Generated by `retro.py accuracy --write`. One row per sprint retro: how many POINTS the sprint
delivered, what the plan forecast the batch would cost, and what it actually cost.

VELOCITY IS THE POINTS COLUMN. It is the number an agile team plans with, and the reason it is
here rather than a token total is that the tokens-per-point RATE is DERIVED from it - actual
tokens over points delivered, re-measured every sprint from this file. A rate that is written
down as a constant instead is an article of faith within two sprints, and this project has
twice had to delete one. Nothing may hardcode it: read it back with `retro.py velocity`.

The Points are the sizes the PLAN recorded, never the sizes on the artefacts today. A size
revised once the outcome was known is not an estimate, and the whole point of the column is
that it was written down before anyone knew.

The Estimate column is the forecast AS RECORDED AT PLAN TIME, and the Constants column names
the estimator that produced it. Neither is ever recomputed. A row re-derived from whatever the
constants say today is not a record of a prediction, and a history of those cannot falsify the
estimator that wrote it: recalibrate, and every past sprint is retroactively deemed to have
forecast something else.

Read the Sample column before the Ratio. IN-SAMPLE means the constants in force were fitted to
that sprint's actuals: its ratio is training error, it lands near 1.0x by construction, and it
is evidence of nothing. Only an OUT-OF-SAMPLE row - forecast by the constants in force, on a
sprint they were not fitted to - tells you whether the estimator works. The planner quotes only
those.

Read the Oversized column before trusting a row's Tokens/pt. It counts the units the sprint
delivered ABOVE the split threshold, and a point stops being a stable unit of cost up there:
measured, the 13s ran 1.9x cheaper per point than every band below, so a row with an oversized
unit in it has a rate dragged downward by a unit that should have been decomposed.

This is a RECORD, not a calibration. Nothing here re-fits the forecast constants
automatically - a fit to a handful of sprints would fit noise. A human reads the trend
and decides whether the constants have earned a change.

Read the coverage columns too. A ratio computed over 2 rated units of 10 is a ratio about
2 units, and the row says so.

Read the MODEL column before comparing any two rows. Cost per unit is meaningless without
knowing which model paid it: a sprint delivered by a smaller model must not land in the same
average as one delivered by a larger, and the mean of the two would describe neither. A sprint
that MIXED models records `mixed` and NO ratio at all, rather than an averaged number that is
about no run that ever happened.

    velocity loop needs. A batch-level count, so it is not attributed to any single unit.

    The estimate is the forecast the planner RECORDED when it planned the sprint
    (`telemetry.forecasts`), read back verbatim. It is never re-derived from the constants in
    force - there is no such path, not even as a fallback. An estimate recomputed at judgement
    time, from the model it is meant to be judging, is not a prediction: recalibrate and every
    past sprint is retroactively deemed to have forecast something else, the ratio drifts to
    1.0x, and the loop can never falsify its own estimator. A recorded 5.2x miss - the entire
    evidence for one recalibration - was erased that way by the recalibration it caused.

    THE POINTS ARE READ BACK THE SAME WAY, from the same record, for the same reason. A size
    read off the artefact today may have been revised once the outcome was known, and a size
    revised with hindsight is not an estimate. So a unit whose plan recorded no points is
    UNSIZED: it is named, it contributes no points to the velocity, and nothing invents a
    number for it.

    Per unit: the recorded size, the recorded forecast, the measured actual, the ratio
    (estimate / actual, so >1 means the plan over-forecast) and the tokens it cost per point -
    which is the number that says whether the SIZE was right, not merely whether a token number
    was. Per batch: the same, summed over the RATED units - those with BOTH a recorded forecast
    and a measurement - plus the points delivered, the sprint's measured rate, and any unit
    delivered above the split threshold.

    Both silences are named, and both are excluded from both sides of the ratio:
      UNMEASURED - forecast, but no telemetry record. Silence is not a measurement.
      UNFORECAST - measured, but no plan-time forecast was recorded. Silence on the estimate
                   side is not evidence either, and it is not an invitation to invent one.

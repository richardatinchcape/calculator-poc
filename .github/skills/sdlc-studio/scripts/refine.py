"""refine - decompose a request (RFC/CR) into an epic and stories, with the links wired.

A request sits in the DISCOVERY backlog; it becomes DELIVERY work only by being broken down into
the units that deliver it. `refine` is that step made a command: it validates the request is
refinable, creates an epic and its stories, and writes the bidirectional `Parent:` /
`Decomposed-into:` links the two-backlog gates verify - the wiring an operator otherwise does by
hand. It is also the migration tool: refining an old childless CR into stories is exactly what an
upgrading project must do.

This module is the DETERMINISTIC CORE (US0129): given the request, an epic title and the story
breakdown (title + points), it creates and wires everything atomically-enough (it validates the
whole breakdown before minting anything, so a bad point value mints nothing). Proposing a GOOD
breakdown is a judgement the agent/operator makes and passes in; refine does not invent it.

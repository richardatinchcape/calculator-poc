"""SDLC Studio lifecycle-conformance check.

Asserts each unit (story) passed through the required lifecycle stages -
decomposed (an Epic link), specified (at least one AC), verifiable (a `Verify:`
line), and for Done stories: verified (AC marked `Verified: yes/manual`),
reconciled (no index drift, via reconcile), and critiqued (a committed APPROVE from
a critic whose reviewer id differs from the unit's author id, via critic.py). The
critic stage is an independence gate: a self-review, or a verdict with no recorded
author, never clears Done - and that floor applies to generic workers too, not only
persona-framed ones. Exits non-zero on any non-conformant unit, so the sprint loop
cannot mark a unit Done with a stage silently skipped - including skipping the critic
or self-reviewing it. Read-only; pure stdlib.

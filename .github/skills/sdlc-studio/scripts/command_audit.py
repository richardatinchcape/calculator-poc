"""Audit the skill command surface against the process spine.

The surface has grown organically; this tool ENUMERATES every command and route
deterministically, maps each to the process spine, and assigns a keep / fold / retire
disposition - the map a cleanup acts on, kept re-runnable so the surface cannot silently
drift again. It does NOT itself retire anything (that is a reviewed, editorial step); it
produces the evidence.

The process spine (CR reference): raise a bug/CR/RFC/Issue -> break it down into the delivery
backlog -> run sprints with independent reviews. The top-level human levers are the documents
(PRD, TRD, TSD, Personas); reconcile / review / audit are support. A command that does not serve
that spine is a candidate to fold or retire.

Three signals feed the disposition, all structural (facts, not taste):
  - SPINE      : the curated category a command serves (or `unmapped` - a review candidate)
  - DRIFT      : a command in the help catalogue but not the SKILL Type Reference, or vice versa
  - TOOLING    : (with --check-tools) does the backing script's `--help` run? a dead route is a
                 help entry whose tool is broken or missing

Skill-development tool: it inspects the SKILL itself, so for a CONSUMING project (no SKILL.md
under the root) it is a no-op. Pure stdlib.

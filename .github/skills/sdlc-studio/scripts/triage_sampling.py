"""SDLC Studio triage sampling policy + triage-quality metrics (schema v3, EP0014).

Once triage becomes a sampled human audit rather than a gate, two questions
follow: *which* triaged findings should a human look at, and *how good* is the triage over time.

- **Sampling policy** (`sample`): deterministic given a seed. Every Critical is sampled, every
  raiser/triager severity disagreement is sampled, and a configured fraction
  (`triage.sample_rate`) of the rest - selected by a stable hash of `(seed, id)` so the same
  batch and seed always pick the same subset (reproducible over a fixture).
- **Triage-quality metrics** (`metrics`): computed from the records, never hand-counted. The
  false-positive rate (a finding triaged into the workflow but later closed invalid) and severity
  inflation (raiser severity vs the triager's) come straight from the artefacts' `Severity` /
  `Triage-severity` / status fields. Sampled-but-unreviewed findings surface as standing pending
  audit, not a one-time prompt.

Pure stdlib. Dormant unless the project is schema v3 (the metrics simply find no triaged findings
on a v2 project, since `Triage-severity` is a v3 field).

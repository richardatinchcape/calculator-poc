## PRD Workflows

## /sdlc-studio prd create - Step by Step {#prd-create-workflow}

1. **Gather Project Context**
   Use AskUserQuestion to collect:
   - Project name and one-line description
   - Target users (who will use this?)
   - Problem being solved (what pain point?)
   - Tech stack preferences

2. **Scan Existing Documentation**
   Look for context in:
   - README.md, README files
   - docs/ folder
   - package.json, requirements.txt, pyproject.toml
   - Existing architecture docs

3. **Feature Discovery**
   For each major feature area, ask:
   - Feature name and description
   - User story ("As a [user], I want to [action] so that [benefit]")
   - Acceptance criteria (testable conditions)
   - Priority (must-have, should-have, nice-to-have)

   Continue until user indicates feature list is complete.

4. **Non-Functional Requirements**
   Ask about:
   - Performance expectations
   - Security requirements
   - Scalability needs
   - Availability targets

5. **Technical Considerations**
   Ask about:
   - External integrations
   - Data storage requirements
   - Deployment environment
   - AI/ML components (if applicable)

6. **Write PRD**
   - Create sdlc-studio/ directory if needed
   - Use template from `templates/core/prd.md`
   - Use confidence markers: [HIGH], [MEDIUM], [LOW]
   - Include Open Questions for unresolved items

7. **Persona Consultation** (default when personas exist)

   **Default behaviour:** When `sdlc-studio/personas/` exists and contains persona files, persona consultation runs automatically. Use `--skip-personas` to opt out.

   - Load persona index and identify relevant personas for PRD review
   - Run consultation: `/sdlc-studio consult team sdlc-studio/prd.md`
   - Append consultation summary to PRD or report separately
   - If personas don't exist, suggest: "Run `/sdlc-studio persona create` for stakeholder feedback"

8. **Offer the team** (both create and generate; OFFER, never auto-run)

   With the PRD written, offer `persona generate --team` - the PRD is the richest input
   the generator will ever have, and the working seats it grows carry THIS project's
   risk axes into every later consult and review. If the operator declines, the shipped
   default seats keep working; `status`/`hint` carry the same offer as an advisory
   until a seat card exists.

---

## /sdlc-studio prd generate - Step by Step {#prd-generate-workflow}

1. **Launch Exploration**
   Use Task tool with Explore agent:

   ```text
   Explore this codebase comprehensively:
   1. Directory structure and architecture patterns
   2. README and documentation files
   3. Configuration (package.json, docker-compose, .env.example)
   4. Database schemas and migrations
   5. API routes and endpoints
   6. Test files (to understand expected behaviour)
   7. AI/ML configurations (prompts, model settings)
   Return a structured report of findings.
   ```

2. **Feature Extraction**
   From exploration, identify:
   - Core functionality implemented
   - User-facing features vs internal utilities
   - Integration points
   - Data models and relationships

3. **Infer Requirements**
   For each feature:
   - Reconstruct the likely user story
   - Document observable behaviour as acceptance criteria
   - Assess completeness (Complete, Partial, Stubbed, Broken)

4. **Technical Analysis**
   Document:
   - Architecture pattern
   - Security measures found
   - Error handling approach
   - Configuration and environment variables

5. **Write PRD**
   - Use confidence markers throughout
   - Include Technical Debt Register (TODOs, FIXMEs)
   - Include Open Questions for ambiguities

6. **Persona Consultation (Recommended)**
   For generated PRDs, persona review is especially valuable:
   - If personas exist, automatically suggest Three Amigos review
   - Generated PRDs may have inferred requirements that need validation
   - Run: `/sdlc-studio consult team sdlc-studio/prd.md --thorough`
   - Flag any requirements that personas question for manual review

---

## /sdlc-studio prd review - Step by Step {#prd-review-workflow}

> **The PRD is owned by the Product Owner seat.** A review of the PRD (here, and the PRD leg of the
> unified `review`) ends with the Product Owner's "PRD requirements satisfied: yes / no (gaps: …)"
> sign-off - the review is not complete until the requirements are confirmed met or the gaps are
> named and tracked. See `reference-workflow-personas.md#document-owner-seats`.

1. **Read Existing PRD**
   - Load from sdlc-studio/prd.md
   - Parse Feature Inventory section
   - Extract features with current status

2. **Analyse Implementation**
   For each feature, use Task tool with Explore agent:

   ```text
   Search for implementation of: [feature name]
   Look for:
   1. Relevant code files and functions
   2. Test coverage
   3. Documentation mentioning this feature
   4. Configuration related to this feature
   Assess: Complete, Partial, Stubbed, Broken, or Not Started?
   ```

3. **Discover New Features**
   - Look for functionality not documented
   - Check recent commits
   - Identify undocumented capabilities

4. **Update PRD**
   - Update status for each feature
   - Add newly discovered features
   - Update last-modified date
   - Add changelog entry

5. **Report Changes**
   - Features marked complete
   - Features still in progress
   - New features discovered
   - Any regressions

6. **Persona Consultation** (default when personas exist)

   **Default behaviour:** When `sdlc-studio/personas/` exists, persona consultation runs automatically during PRD review. Use `--skip-personas` to opt out.

   - Load persona index and consult relevant personas on review findings
   - Quick mode for minor changes: `/sdlc-studio consult team prd.md --quick`
   - Thorough mode for major changes: `/sdlc-studio consult team prd.md --thorough`
   - Include persona verdicts in the review report
